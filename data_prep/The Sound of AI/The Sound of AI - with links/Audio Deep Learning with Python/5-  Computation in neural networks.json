I'm gonna introduce you the multi-layered perception, which is a simple neural network and we're gonna see how it works and the math behind it. So to get started, let's take a look at an old friend, the artificial neuron. So if you remember, we, we said that an artificial neuron is a computational unit that's able to process some information and do some transformation on it. Well, the question is, so if the artificial neuron is a computational unit, why do we need a neural network? Isn't an artificial neuron good enough by itself? Well, it turns out that if you want to work on quite complex problems, you want to scale up to networks of neurons or neural networks because a single neuron is really good if you are",

Well, it turns out that if you want to work on quite complex problems, you want to scale up to networks of neurons or neural networks because a single neuron is really good if you are dealing with linear problems. But if you're dealing with more complex problems like real world problems or where there's a lot of like non linearity in it. Well, a single neuron, it's not going to cut it. You're gonna need a network of neurons which work together.",
