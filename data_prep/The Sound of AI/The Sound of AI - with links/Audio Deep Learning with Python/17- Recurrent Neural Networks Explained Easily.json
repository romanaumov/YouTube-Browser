        "text": "Hi, everybody and welcome to another video in the Deep Learning for audio with Python series. This time we're gonna talk about recurrent neural networks and understand the theory behind it. So let's get started and understand what R and NS are, what they do, what type of data they process. Now there's a lot of data in which order is extremely important. That's true. For example, like for text and words. So let's analyze for example, the the sentence Anna loves John. Well, here order is very important because Anna loves John is very different from John loves Anna, right? And the point being that like order is so important that many like bad things can happen. Like if you don't understand whether like Anna loves you or John loves Anna, right? OK. So in that sense, like order is very important for data, certain type of data like time series as well where we have like data uh which are like measures like of of different values that are taken like a certain intervals and ordered like over time, right?",

So for example, in the case of a waveform, which is a univariate time series, the, the this third dimension here would be equal to one. In the case of the MF CCS with 13 coefficients, we would have 13 here. And that's a Multivariate time series. Remember that. OK.

And so here we have the back size as the first dimension, the, the number of steps. And this is the second dimension and the number of units as the third dimension. And in this case, we have 293 cool. So now what remains to do is look at the uh hidden state or the state vector. And it turns out that in simple R and NS the state vector is equal to the outputs, right. So for example, here this H zero is equal to Y zero. And obviously the dimensionality is the same. So we have like 23, that's good.",
