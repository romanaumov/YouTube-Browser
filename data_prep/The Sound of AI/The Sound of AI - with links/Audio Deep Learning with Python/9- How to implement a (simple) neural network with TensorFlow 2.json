Is this amazing deep learning library that's like used very much in the industry and also in academia and it has its own way of building and processing information and neural networks. So obviously, we're gonna follow that. So what should we do? Well, first thing that we want to do is to build a model. So we need to build the architecture of our network. Then once we have the architecture, we want to compile the model, which basically means passing information like the error function that we want to use or like the optimizer that we want to use uh in our training uh process. Then we indeed want to train the model",

So uh what are we gonna do next in the next video? Well, uh in the next video, we're finally at a moment where we can start to look at all your data. And so we'll preprocess all your data. So that we will have it in such a way that we then can use it with our deep learning algorithms, which is super nice. Cool. So this was it for this video. I hope you enjoyed it.
