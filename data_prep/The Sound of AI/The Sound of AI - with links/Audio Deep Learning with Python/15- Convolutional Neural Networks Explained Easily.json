        "text": "Hi everybody and welcome to yet another video in the deep learning for audio with Python series. This time, it's super exciting because we are looking into convolutional neural networks and we'll try to explain how they work on a theoretical level, right? So what are CNN S? Well CNN S are quite advanced type of um neural network. And they've been mainly used for processing images. And over time, we've found out that they are way better at performing liquid images than the equivalent, for example, like multi-layered perception uh architecture. And the the great thing about CNN S is that they have at the same time way less parameters than dense layers. So when analyzing images, we have this double advantage, so they perform better and they have less parameters than the multi layer perception. But now you may be wondering, but why is that the case? Well, it turns out that image data is somehow uh structured.",

Well, it turns out that image data is somehow uh structured. So the pixels are not just like randomly like uh positions like in an image, but usually there are certain emergent structures. So for example, you have structures like edges shapes, you have invariants to translation, you have scale invariants So for example, a square remains a square, square re regardless of how big the square is, right?",

But regardless, let's assume 18 is correct. OK. So we'll take that 18 and we'll just it in here in the output grid over here, right? So how do we continue here? Well, it's quite simple because now we slide the kernel on the image here and we slide to the right and now we center the uh the kernel on this like index here with the the one highlighted in green in the image, right? And we redo the the dot products and we get 10, we move on, we slide and we get like another value and it's minus three, we slide again and we get five. Now we go",

It's the step size that we use for sliding the kernel on the image, right? So, and the stride itself again is indicated in pixels. So let's try to look at a stride. Uh So here we have um our image and we have a three by three kernel that we are applying. Now, we let's say we have a stride, a one. So we'll just move like this. So we start here, then we'll move this by one pixel and then we'll keep moving by another pixel and so on and so forth. And so as you can see, we are sliding just by one pixel and this is a stride of one. Now, let's take, let's try a stride of two.

And, and so here uh we have like these values, right? And given we are doing max pooling, we just pick the, the greatest value and we log it in the output grid over here, right? OK. And so in by doing so we are down sampling uh the original input because basically we are just like getting one parameter out of like these four parameters. Now, how are we gonna continue doing this?

And so because of like those structures that we can identify in spectrogram and MS CCS CNN work really really well because they are able to extract features while we uh like apply them when we apply like convolutions like on the uh on the audio data, right? So now that we have an intuition of how like all your data can be used in CN MS. Let's try to look at a specific example where we look at MF CCS for uh data, right? And so now the question uh that I want to ask you is like given like these uh settings for uh these like MF CCS like and for all of these audio data, what's gonna be like the, the data shape, right? So we have 13 MFCC,",

Now, if you don't re remember what a hop length is or an MFCC uh like is just like go back to my previous videos where I introduced like all of these audio features. Cool. So we said hop length 512 samples and then we have the total number of samples in a audio file that we are analyzing. That's conveniently 51,200.
