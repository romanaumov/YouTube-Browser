In this video, we're gonna have an overview at artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning. These are some of the uh topics that we're gonna be covering during the video. So we're gonna define artificial intelligence and see the relationship with machine learning and deep learning. And then we're going to talk about a number of different machine learning flavors or paradigms like supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. Then we're gonna get into de defining deep learning and then we're gonna see the difference between traditional machine learning and deep learning. And finally, we're gonna be talking a little bit about possible applications of deep learning in audio and music technology. Cool. So let's get started with uh the relationship between artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning. Usually",

And obviously, as you can see here, there are certain things that uh can't be identified and are like this smaller uh outbursts of energy here because like they are less than 0.2 or uh like in, in terms of like amplitude.

So usually with traditional machine learning, you, you can, you can you can make it with a relatively small data set. And here at least we're talking about like thousands of samples. But for deep learning, you really need large data sets. And so here we're talking about hundreds of thousands, if not millions because uh traditional machine learning is way less computational intensive, whereas deep learning is very resource intensive. And so all of these like differences like mm make it like ideal for traditional machine learning to tackle relatively simple problems. Whereas for deep learning, um its ideal application is with complex problems, deep learning works really really well. For example, with problems that with traditional machine learning, like it's very difficult like to to to tackle like for example, like um image recognition or a bunch of like audio uh A I problems uh like speech recognition or like genre classification and all of this kind of uh of things, right?",
