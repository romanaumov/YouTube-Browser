But in reality, if you really want to understand how neurons work, then yes, you need to know a bit of linear algebra. So that's why in this video we're going to talk about vector and matrix operations. So let's get started with vectors. What are vectors? Well, vectors are just a ray of numbers. We notate vectors with small caps bolts, a letter like this a vector here. And then we can arrange a vector that's a collection of different items both horizontally. And then we have a row vector or vertically and we have a column vector. So on vectors, we can perform a number of different operations",

So this is like a very simple way of remembering how a matrix multiplication works. So this was a little bit like weirder than all the other um operations that we've seen so far. But as you'll see, this is very, very important because we can use all of this notation to easily capture how a neuron network performs its computations. And that's what we're gonna see in the next video. So we're gonna look at neuron networks and specifically at multi layer perceptions and see how they compute the information when the signal moves from left to right.",

So this was it for this very quick, I would say like very quick introduction to linear algebra. I hope you enjoyed this. And if you like the video, please subscribe.
