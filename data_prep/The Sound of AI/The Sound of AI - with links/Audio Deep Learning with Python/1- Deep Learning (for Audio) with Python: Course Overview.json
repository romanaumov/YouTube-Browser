So first of all, I want you to understand the capabilities and limits of deep learning. So what's possible and what's not possible? Then after that, we're gonna learn a lot about the fundamental theory behind neural networks. We're gonna learn a little bit about the math, for example, that powers this very powerful algorithms. And then we're gonna move on to more practice based stuff and we're gonna learn how to code deep learning uh networks using industry standards, deep learning libraries like tensorflow. And then obviously we're going to play around with a bunch of different types of neural networks. So like R and MS CNN s and we're gonna learn what all of these acronyms like really stand for. Cool.

Yes, you can because at the end of the day, this is a deep learning course.

        "text": "As I mentioned. This is not a course for Python beginners rather, you should have some intermediate coding skills. Because at the end of the day, I'm not gonna teach you how to code. The focus of this course is on A I not coding itself. Now, if you know uh quite a lot about basic linear algebra, that's fantastic, but it's definitely not necessary because I'm going to cover all the math. We'll need to understand neural networks at the same time. If you know about audio digital signal processing, that's fantastic. But it's not really necessary because again, I'm going to cover all the DS P stuff that we really need. Cool. So this was it for the course overview. So now just brace yourself, deep learning is coming. Bye.",
