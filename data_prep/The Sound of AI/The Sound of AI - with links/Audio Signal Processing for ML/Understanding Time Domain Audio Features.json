Last time we introduced the extraction pipelines for both time domain and frequency domain features. This time, I'm going to be introducing time domain audio features specifically, I'm going to focus on a few very important types them in audio features and explain the theory behind them. But before we get started, let me recall you once uh remind you once again about the sound of the I Slack community. This is a community of people interested in all things A I audio A I music audio signal processing. So if you want to improve your knowledge in the field and network with great people, I highly suggest you to go check out the sign up link that I've left in the description below now on to the good stuff. OK. So these are the 310 domain features that we'll be uh focusing on today. So these are amplitude envelope root mean square energy and zero crossing rate. So all of these features",

In other words, we take these features at each frame in an audio signal, then obviously, we can just like take like all of these values that we have for each frame and then we can aggregate them with some statistical means like mean sum or things that are a little bit more sophisticated like Gaussian mixture models.",

But now we are, so this, this is gonna give us information only for 10 crossing, not two. So we have to divide this two by two and it's given over here so that we're gonna have just like a value of one here. Now, what we do is we uh kind of like uh sum over all the samples that we have in a um in a frame. And so that we are gonna get like the values for all these zero crossings that we have in a frame. OK. So that's like a simple, like mathematical formula that's very elegant for defining zero crossing rate. Now, let's take a look at some applications. As I said, this is like uh like zero crossing rate is extensively used in speech recognition as well as like in music processing.",
