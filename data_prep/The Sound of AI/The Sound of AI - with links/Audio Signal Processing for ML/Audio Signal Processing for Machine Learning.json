        "text": "Hi, everybody and welcome to a new exciting video series called audio signal processing for machine learning. Many of you guys have asked me to dig deeper into audio digital signal processing and so here you have a whole series on that. In this video, I'm gonna give you a quick overview of the series, the different content, the things that you learn, the perquisites and the resources. Now, what's the problem? Why do we need this series? So the main issue that probably most deep learning engineers know is that when it comes time to work on deep learning applications for images, that's not that much of an issue because we have a lot of resources that explain how you can process image a road data and make it viable for deep learning and machine learning models. But that's not necessarily the case for audio, there's a sort of mist around audio data and how you should use it for",

Well, if you are a machine learning or more specifically deep learning engineer and you're tapping your feet into the audio domain, this is a perfect series for you. Same thing. If you are a computer science student, I've received a ton of requests from CS students who have asked me, how can I uh preprocess audio data for this specific audio A I application? Well, you're going to get most of those answers here in this um series. Now, if you are a software engineer with an interest in audio and music, again, this is uh a series that's for you. And of course, if you are a music technologist or a tech oriented musician who wants to dig deeper into uh audio and computation, again, this is an ideal series for you. Great. So obviously, this is not gonna be a series for uh beginners, Python, uh beginners rather you should have intermediate Python skills in order to follow the coding um sessions.",

And so you can really ask a bunch of questions and grow your understanding of the topic while uh networking with a lot of like cool and knowledgeable people. Good. So I'll leave the link to the sound of the eyes lack workspace below in the description. Just go check that out and sign up. OK. So this was, was all for today. I'm looking forward to starting this journey with you and I hope you'll join in",
