This is a flavor of spectrograms that is extensively used in A I audio research and A I audio real world applications. But before we get started into mel spectrograms, I want to give you an overview of what we did over the last couple of videos and that is the short time fourier transform. And we also looked into extracting and visualizing spectrograms. Now, if you're not familiar with this concept, I highly suggest you to go check out my previous two videos, cos what I'm going to say next in the video builds on top of this two notions extensively. Now without further ado let's move on to this visualization of a spectrogram. And as you can see here on the X axis, we have time on the Y axis. As usual we have uh frequency and each point which is represented by a color in this two D representation uh tells us how present a certain frequency is at each point in time.",

And it's this like empirical uh like formula here as it said, like found by trial and error with experiments. And the important thing here, apart from all of this like um constants is like the logarithm that we use. And indeed, we have like this logarithm logarithmic kind of relationship. Now, we can take the inverse of this function. And with this, we're gonna be able to move from melts back to Hertz. Now, I want to just let you rem just like, yeah, keep in mind these two formulas because we're gonna be needing them like moving forward. OK. So now you should have like a basic idea of the male scale and why it is important in terms of like the way we perceive um music or not music, sorry we perceive pitch in this case. OK.

So the number of columns that we have sorry, the number of rows that we have in the spectrogram is equal to the unique frequency uh plus one and the number of columns is given by the number of frames or in other words like the temporal bins.
