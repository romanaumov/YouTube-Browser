In other words, Mal frequency seal coefficient or if we use their acronym MF CCS. But before we get started with this super cool topic, I want to remind you about the sound of the Ice L community. So if you sign up there, you can get feedback, share projects and share ideas with a community of people who are interested in A I audio A I music and audio signal processing. So I really invite you to check this community out and I'll leave you the link and the sign up link to the Slack workspace in the description box below. Now let's move on to the cool stuff. But before we get to M I want just like to remind you about what we did in the previous couple of videos and we focused on male spectrograms. Now male spectrograms are going to be like an important building block to understanding MF CCS. So if you are really not that familiar with that, I highly suggest you to go check out my previous couple of videos on male spectrograms. OK? But now let's get started with MFC",

So how do we compute the SES stream? Well, we compute it like this. So now here we have like our ses strum and we indicate that like S capital T and uh the sere is provided by like this formula here. So let's get started with XFT. Well, XFT is just like a normal uh signal in the time domain, right, it's just like normal waveform then out of this normal waveform, what we do is we take the uh discrete fourier transform, which here I've indicated with this capital F. And so when we do that, we come up with a spectrum and we move from the time domain to the frequency domain. OK. Now the next step that we want to do is apply a logarithm to the spectrum.",

In other words, the spectral envelope provides us information about timer about the uh the different like phones that we have in speech. So this is extremely important because like this is like a feature that we want to isolate to do speech processing. OK. OK. So the spectral envelope turns out is something like very similar to the vocal tract frequency response, right? So and this is like the the the input response like of the vocal tract depending on how we shape the vocal tract. And it's gonna give us like a signal like this that resembles like this spectral envelope here, right? And depending on how you shape your vocal tract, uh you're gonna have a slightly different vocal tract frequency response with different forms, right? And that is gonna determine uh different tres, different identities of sound. OK. So this iii I hope like you're starting to understand how important like this is, right? And now",

And basically what we are, what we want to do is try to decompose uh that signal into its quefrency components and see how present the different QF components are. OK.

So this is gonna, it's usually used in music and audio um speech processing really.

        "text": "as I said, MS CCS are an extremely, have been an extremely important audio feature now a little bit less. So because the trend with deep learning has been to move towards audio data that are like as rare as possible. So we are now using spectrograms or male spectrograms most of the time and of MF CCS. But still it's very important to have like a deep understanding of MF CCS because like they provide us like with a clear, I don't know like a clear example of how you can create like something really cool in terms and relevant in terms of like audio features using a bunch of different transformations. And also to understand what time before the deep learning wave like with all applications in speech and music processing. And of this, I want to talk so we can use MF CCS for speech processing. And here we can use them for uh as the main and only features for doing speech recognition, speaker recognition, speaker diar.",

And here we can use them for uh as the main and only features for doing speech recognition, speaker recognition, speaker diar. And also we can use them extensively for music processing. So you can use it for music genre classification, mood classification, automatic tagging because it turns out that a sis are very good describers for music as well and because they're capable of capturing the timer of instruments. So all of the um tasks in music processing that have to deal with timer features",

So all of the um tasks in music processing that have to deal with timer features are a good candidate for using MF CCS. And that's because MF CCS are mainly time centric and they are more or less like pitch in variant, right? But obviously you wouldn't use uh MF CCS for, for example, like for identifying codes, right? Because you're not really getting that much of a uh that much pitch information",

Because you're not really getting that much of a uh that much pitch information good. So I think like you should really, really congratulate like yourself because uh we've done a lot of work like in this video. So we looked at the subs, we looked like at the math behind subst, we looked at the visualization of the subs how we can interpret subst in the context of speech. And then we moved on to male frequency subs coefficients.",
