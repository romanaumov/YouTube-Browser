Last time, we looked at the theory behind a few frequency domain audio features. This time, I'm gonna implement one of those from scratch in Python. And the one that I'll be implementing is called band energy ratio. I'm not gonna get too much into the the theoretical details of this because I've done this like in the previous video. So if you find yourself not understanding what I'm talking about, just go back to my previous video which should be over here. OK? So let's take a look at this notebook. Uh And as you can see, I've already implemented some code and that's because this is like stuff that we've seen multiple times throughout this series and I didn't want to spend my time like coding, typing this down.",

Whereas in rock music, you have a more balanced distribution and that's probably has to do with the fact that there are a lot of like noisy uh sounds like snares or like stuff like this that just like provides energy or offers energy in the higher end of the spectrum in rock music. OK. So uh by now, you should be able to have, well, you should have like a very deep understanding of band energy ratio, how to calculate it from scratch with Python. And you probably also have an idea of how bent energy ratio like works in different genres, which is great. So that's all really for today. So next time we'll be uh looking into the remaining two frequency to all your features and how to like implement, but we won't implement them from scratch, but rather we'll be using uh Li Breza for uh implementing them. So if you've enjoyed the video, please leave a like if you haven't subscribed and want more content like this, please uh subscribe to the channel and I guess I'll see you next time. Cheers.",
