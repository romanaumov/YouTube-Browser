This time we'll be using that knowledge and we'll extract mel spectrograms using Python and li browser. So without any further ado, let's get started. So the first thing that we wanna do is just like import a bunch of like packages. So li browser, li browser doc display and map, put lip just like for review stuff. Next, we want to actually load uh an audio file with lib browser. So the first thing that we'll do is just um get a reference to uh the path to the file. And next we want to do is just like play you guys back like this audio file and you should be familiar with this because it's the one that we used also uh when we actually extracted uh vanilla spectrograms a couple of years ago. So let's listen to this scale and we have a second repetition of the same pattern.",

Then we should specify the some the frame size, the H length. And these are uh this is all the information that we need for extracting the spectrogram. And then we also need to pass the number of male bands which yeah, let's put it just like equal to 90 for example, right? And as I said, what ma spectrogram does under the hood is calculating the uh vanilla spectrogram. It creates the male filter banks and apply the male filter banks uh to the spectrogram. OK.
