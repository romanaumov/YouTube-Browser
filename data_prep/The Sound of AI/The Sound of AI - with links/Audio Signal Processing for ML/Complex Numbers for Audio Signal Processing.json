        "text": "Hi, everybody and welcome to a new video in the audio signal processing for machine learning series. This time we'll pick up where we left last time where we talked about fourier transform and arrived at the point where we said, well, we need to know about complex numbers for moving forward and understand fourier transform even better than just like the intuition level. So this time, we'll look into the fundamental concepts behind numbers. And all of this information is going to be very useful for you to understand the deeper concepts behind uh audio signal processing. But before we get started, I want to remind you once again about the sound of the Ice Luck community, which is a community with people interested in all things A I music A and all your signal processing. So you can go there, hang out with very interesting people and uh network with them, ask for feedback and just share your ideas. So if you're interested and you're not signed up yet, just go check out the sign up link to the workspace Slack workspace in the description below. But now let's move on to the topic of today's video. The complex numbers. So why should we butter with complex numbers in the first place? Well,",

Now the moment we have these two parameters, we can move easily from the uh from the cars coordinate representation to the polar coordinate representation. But before we do that, we need to calculate both absolute value of C and gamma. Let's start with absolute value of C. And here we can use like some very basic math, something that probably you, you've done like in high school, if not elementary school. So here we, I just like reread this and added uh like these um colors, colored lines for clarity. So the purple line here is a, here we have B which is represented by this um yellow line. And obviously, we have the hypotenuse of this triangle which is absolute value of C.",

Now, if you're wondering about e this is the base of the natural logarithm. Now this is like a very, very nice formula. And uh it's kind of looks similar to what we are looking at at our um a polar representation of the complex numbers. But let's try to visualize and understand what this is on a plot, what this exponential is on a plot. And so as you can see here, so what the exponential does, it basically traces the unit circle. So what's the unit circle is the circle that has a radius one and it traces it counter clockwise. And in order to like just trace the circle, what we do is we just increase the angle gamma. The eer formula is going to be very useful to rewrite our polar coordinates for the complex numbers. But before we get there, I want to take a little detail to show you one of the beauty, one of the jewels in mathematics and that's the Euler identity.",

        "text": "now we have a very complex way of representing complex numbers. And we are going to be using uh this absolute value as a way of mapping our magnitude that we have like in our fourier transform. And we're going to be using this exponential and specifically this gamma to talk about the face that we get out of a fourier transform for a given pure tone. And so this is the type of like kind of like mental exercise that we'll use in the next video where we are actually gonna put into place all of the knowledge that we've acquired today about complex numbers in order to create a complex representation of the fourier transform. And you'll be delighted by that because it's gonna look like so wonderful and so simple, good. So this was like a quite intense video film, but I hope that you've enjoyed it because now you should have a good understanding, an operational understanding of complex numbers, uh their uh representation in Cartesian coordinates in polar coordinates, the Euler formula, the exponential and all of this like nice things here.",
