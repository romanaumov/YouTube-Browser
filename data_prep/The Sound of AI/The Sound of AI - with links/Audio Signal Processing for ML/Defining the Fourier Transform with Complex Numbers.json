Last time we introduced complex numbers and we said that we would need this to introduce many aspects of audio signal processing. And so this time we'll just build on top of that knowledge and we'll use complex numbers to define the fourier transform in complex terms. And as you'll see, this is gonna be super compact and super elegant. But before we get started, I just want to remind you about the sound of the I Slack community here. You can talk with a lot of like cool people who are interested in A IOU and A I music and you can also get feedback. So I really suggest you to check this out. I'll leave you the sign up link in the description below now onto the cool stuff. So I want to remind you about like a couple of things that I introduced some math stuff that I introduced over the last couple of meters. And the first couple of formulas are these two and this is the formula on top over here for um getting like the face as a parameter of the fourier transform. And then we have the mag",

But if you want to just dig into like this notebook, feel free to do it. I'll just leave you the link uh to the github where the core is. Uh the code is stored in my description below. But now let's take a look at this signal. So what I've done here, you can quickly take a look at this. So I take in like a frequency and I use that like as a fundamental frequency. And so I have like a sine wave and I it's superimposed in a couple of other sine waves, the sine to and sine three and these have double the original the fundamental frequency and triple the fundamental uh frequency cool. OK. So now let's uh take a look at the results for that. And so I have like this nice util utility function that I defined. So plot signal. So I'm passing in the time and the time is between zero and 10 seconds and I have like 10,000 steps and then passing the signal. And as you can see, we have our signal which is time",

So we want to decompose our signal with a sine wave that has frequency 1.1 and the result is the origin is that somewhat unexpected? Well, I'd say no, why is that, why is not, why is not that thing unexpected? Well, that's because we are averaging across all the different points. And here, as you can see, we have like full symmetry and when we average everything, we just end up with zero because all the different points are canceling out. OK. Cool. So this seems to like resonate with, with the intuitive like uh understanding that we had of the free transform, right? So whenever we have a frequency component that's represented, we have a magnitude that's different from zero necessarily. OK. Where, whereas when we are",
