This time, we'll look at the extraction pipelines that we need to extract both time domain features and frequency domain features. Before starting looking into this, I just want to remind you about the sound of the Eye Slack community, which is a community with people interested in all things A I audio A I music and audio digital signal processing. So if you want to improve your skills and network with cool people, just consider signing up there and Olivia sign up link to the community in the description below. Now let's go back to the cool stuff in the previous video. We took a look at a few different types of uh audio features. So time domain features which uh leave in the time domain, frequency domain features which leave in the frequency domain and finally time frequency domain features which are features that provide us with information both about time and frequency.",

So now once you have the uh digitalized version of the sounds, the next step that we want to do here is called framing. In other words, we want to bundle together a bunch of samples.

In other words, what we do is we multiply the original signal by the hand window at each correspondent sample, right? And what we obtain is something that looks like this. And as you can see here, uh because we've applied the hand window, now we've completely smoothened the end points, right? And so we don't have those discontinuities anymore now because the, the signal just goes naturally to zero thanks to the windowing that we've used. OK.",
