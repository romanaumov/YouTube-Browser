        "text": "Hi, everybody and welcome to another video in the audio processing for machine learning series. Last time we talked about basic features of sounds. So what sound is waveforms and introduce the concept of frequency. This time we continue delving into the features of sound, talking about intensity, power, loudness and timbre. So first of all, I want to talk about two, a couple of concepts. So intensity and power and these are like connected together. So let's start from the power of sound. Well, this is we all know how the power of sound, right? But we don't want to talk about the power of sound here. We actually want to talk about the reverse of that, the sound power. So what's the sound power? Well, this is a physical that we can express like this. It's basically the rate at which the energy is transferred. This is basically the idea of the concept of a power in general. But if we talk about sound power specifically, this is the energy per unit of time emitted by a sound source in all directions across, I mean like the air across like the the medium",

And I highly suggest you to go check that out because it's great and it will give you like way more context that what I'm covering here. OK. But here you have a table where we have a lot of like different sound sources and we have like the intensity measured in watts over a squared meters. The and the relative intensity uh level and the uh re that like compared in, in terms of like the threshold of hearing, OK. So like when we whisper, we have an intensity which is at 10 to the minus uh 10, which is basically a 20 decibels. So a normal conversation happens at an intensity of 10 to the minus six which is 60 decibels",

Now we have like one final aspect of timbre. So we said um envelope harmonic content and now frequency and amplitude modulation. So basically modulation in the uh the sound like itself. So what's frequency modulation? So frequency mod modulation is also called in music circles as vibrato, right? And basically here you have um periodic variations in frequency and in music, you have this for expressive purposes. But uh like we can create an effect, a vibrato effect by using like frequency modulation. And this can be formalized. And but basically the idea behind this is that",
