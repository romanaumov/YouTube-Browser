This time, we're gonna introduce a few audio features, but mainly we're gonna be focusing on strategies that we can use to categorize this different audio features. Before we get into that, we should ask a couple of very important questions. One, what are audio features? Two, why are they important to us? Well, audio features are descriptors of sound. And the basic idea here is that when we have different audio features, they will tell us a different or they will uh provide us information about different aspects of sound. And the catch here is that we can use these audio features for training our intelligent audio systems. In other words, we should identify a few of these audio features we're interested in and then pass it into onto our um machine learning system so that they will hopefully like learn patterns and then solve our task or problems. OK.",

And um yeah, so as I said, this is like a strategy categorization strategy that we can use mainly for music for obvious reasons, right? So what about like audio, like more in general? So do we have like also other types of like classifying uh or categorizing audio features for all sorts of audios? Yes. And this is like probably the most important kind of like strategy that you have for categorizing the different audio features. And uh this is based on like the signal domain that we are in. OK.

Like here, we can make a quite important distinction between traditional machine learning algorithms like support vector machines, logistic regression or linear regression and deep learning architectures. And we'll see why that's the case in a second. So for a traditional machine learning, what we usually do is we just look at all the possible audio features both in the audio domain and sorry, both in the time domain and in the frequency domain. And basically what we do is we hand pick the ones that we believe will work the best for the problem that we want to solve. For example, we could say, yeah, we uh we want to solve like audio classification. So we we want to pass to machine learn a support vector machine for example, some like audio files. And then we want to know whether like we have the sound of a car engine of an airplane or or a gunshot for example, right. So what we could do is like identify a few",
