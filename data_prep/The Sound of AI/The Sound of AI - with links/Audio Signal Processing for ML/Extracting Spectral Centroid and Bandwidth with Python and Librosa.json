So what I'm gonna do today is basically show you how you can calculate the spectral Centroid and the spectral bandwidth using libres. OK. So let's get started. So here, as you can see, I already fired up a notebook and wrote down like some stuff. So I'm not gonna go through this like in detail because we've seen this time and again, time and again throughout the series. But basically, so we have like all sorts of imports here with Lisa and other stuff that we'll use here. We are loading some audio files and we are always using the free usual audio files. So the bey piece, an orchestral piece, then a song by Red Hot Chili Peppers and then a nice ballad by Jake Eton. So this is a jazzy music. So here I just like display all of them. I'm not gonna play us back because like we've heard them like multiple times and if you're interested, you can download the uh the network and hear for yourself. And then what I do here, I load all the audio files with LIB browser so that we get both the uh the signal as a non power and the sample rate. OK. So it's now time to calculate the spectral Centroid with libros.",

And to uh yeah, I would say like to the spectral bandwidth is similar to the one that we had regarding the spectral Centroid in a sense like the spectral bandwidth of uh acoustic pieces like classical music or uh jazz music tends to be like smaller than the one that we have for. Um yeah, rock music or yeah, music which like electronic instruments usually or percussions for sure. OK. So yeah, this is it. So now you are able to calculate the spectral centro and the bandwidth using uh Liza. And yeah, I think like that's it for like this video and I just wanted to yeah close like this series like with a few uh with a couple of comments. So one thing I think like this was like an amazing ride. So we went through a lot of things and if you follow it along with like my series now, yeah, you have like a very strong background in audio processing and audio",
