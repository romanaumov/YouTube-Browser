Now, when I was uh planning this video, I thought what's the best way of introducing the fourier transform? And I thought, well, perhaps I should just give you a little bit of intuition there and then go straight into uh implementation or even just use the browser for extracting a spectrum through the fourier transform. But then I thought, well, the fourier transform is at core of signal processing. So just sprinkling a little bit of math here and there and intuition is not going to be enough for you. So you really want to have a deep understanding of the fourier transform and all of its implications. This is why I've decided to divide this topic into a number of videos. And this first video is going to give you a",

So X axis is time, Y axis is amplitude and as you can see, so we have the attack of the sound and then we have a little bit of the DC and then yeah, the sound ends towards like 1.4 seconds. OK. So the next step is the crucial one is the one that we use for deriving the free transform. And we do that by using uh S IP specifically the FFT module. And we use the FFT which stands for fast fourier transform um function in the FFT module. So we pass it in the signal and we get the fourier transform.
