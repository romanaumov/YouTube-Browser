This time we'll continue our quest into the time domain audio features and specifically we'll be extracting the root main squared energy and zero crossing rate features using uh Li Brosa. OK. So let's get started. But before that, I, yeah, I just wanted to tell you that we are going to be rehashing a lot of the code that I used in my previous video where I was extracting amplitude envelope. So yeah, let's just like grab some of this code from here. OK. So the first thing that I want to grab is just like this imports here. So as you can see, I'm importing my plot noon P Li Brosa Li Brosa display for just displaying the waveforms and then I Python display for uh playing audio directly in the Jupiter Notebook. OK. So the next thing that I want to do is just load uh some audio and today just like in the previous video, we're gonna be using three audio files that are like three",

That's because it was passing the amplitude envelope for Debussy, but we don't have that. We have that in the previous video. So let me just grab R MS for the bey. Now, uh the length for R MS DC R MS red hot and R MS D is going to be the same because we have the, these ones that have the very same duration, 30 seconds. OK. So now let's rerun this and it's here, we have it. So in red, you can see the R MS energy in this case for the busy here, for the red hot chili peppers and here for uh J Allington. OK.",
