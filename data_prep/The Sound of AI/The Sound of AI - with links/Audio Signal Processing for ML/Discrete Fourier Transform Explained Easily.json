This time we continue our quest, our journey into the wonderful world of the fourier transform. Specifically, we'll look at the discrete fourier transform. But before getting like our heads down into the DM T or Discord fourier transform, I want to remind you once again about the sound of A I Slack community, which is a community where you can just learn a lot of stuff about audio processing and A I music in general and you can network with very cool people. So if you're interested in joining, I'll leave you the sign up link in the description below. But now let's move on to the cool stuff. OK. Last time, if you guys remember we defined this beast of an equation here, which in other words is simply the fourier transform expressed through complex numbers. Now, I'm not gonna get into the details here and I take for granted that you already know that. But if that's not the case, I suggest you to check out this video, which by the way is my last video. OK?",

So the frequency of a given value K and this frequency obviously is expressed in Hertz is given by this formula here. So it's K divided by N times T capital T where T is the sampling period. If you guys remember from a previous video in this series, the sampling period is the inverse of the sampling rate. In other words, what we can do is a rewrite this formula like this. So K divided by capital N and all of these guys multiplied by the sample",

        "text": "OK. So that's it uh like for this video. Now you should have like a very good understanding of the fourier transform. So we started with intuition of the fourier transform. We moved to like com complex numbers and understood how we can actually use complex numbers for defining the fourier transform in a continuous context. Now, you know about the discrete version of the fourier transform. So you may be wondering should we still be and hear and talk more about the fourier transform? And the answer is yes, definitely. So next time we'll leave like all of this theory behind us and we'll just like do a little bit of like of implementation and play around and extract the magnitude spectrum from a bunch of sounds and kind of like, I",
