Last time we looked uh at the theory behind the discrete fourier transform and the fast fourier transform, which is a flavor of discrete fourier transform. This time, I want to actually extract the fourier transform coefficients using Python and specifically Noon P. Beyond that, I'm going to show you also a bunch of uh different um magnitude spectra for instruments which play the same note so that we can at least have a glance into why we perceive their timer uh differently. OK. So let's get started with our Gipson notebook. And here, first thing I want to import a few libraries that are gonna be useful for our purpose today.",

Then we have like the first harmonic, which it should be around 520 Hertz uh which is very present. And then we have the third, the 4th 5th harmonic and so forth. The interesting thing here is that the uh first harmonic of this violin T four sound has more energy than the fundamental. So which is kind of like interested in itself. OK.
