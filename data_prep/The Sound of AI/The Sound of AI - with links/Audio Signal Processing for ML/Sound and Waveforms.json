        "text": "Hi, everybody and welcome to a new video in the audio processing for machine learning series. This time, we are basically starting the whole series and it's going to be quite theoretical because I want to introduce a few basic ideas. So what's sound? What are waveforms? So what's frequency and how can we use all of those uh notions in audio processing? OK. So let's get started with the basic idea here. So what what is sound well uh sound is produced by uh vibrating objects. So these objects vibrate and these vibrations cause our air molecules to oscillate and to bump into each other and by bumping into each other, these uh air molecules kind of like change the uh state of the air pressure in in like the local region where they are acting. And so they create in this process a wave. So in other words, we can think of sound as a wave that transmits transfer some energy from one point to another through air molecules. OK. But the question is what is a mechanical wave? And I'm talking about mechanical waves here because the sound is",

And the idea of midi notes is that we can attach to each keyboard, a number, a a midi number, right? So for example, the middle C down here uh has a midi note uh which is equal to 60. Now, uh we can map this midi notes to note names. So this midi note 60 is equal to C four. Now, what does that stand for? So we have like a four and note name like two parameters there. So one is a letter and yeah, that's just like the, the the note names, right? CD eff sharp, all these things, right? And the other one is a number. So what's that number? Well, that number represents the octave we are at. So now, I guess like most of you are familiar with the concept of like a scale like or an octave and you've like perhaps played around like with a, with a keyboard, like a piano yourself.

Obviously, we are capable of like picking up like different semitones and understanding that there's a difference in pitch there. But we are better than that. So we are capable of like, um, appreciating pitch differences that are smaller than a Samsung. So how can we measure that? Well, here is where scents come into place. So the idea of a scent is that, uh, it, the, the whole octave is divided in 1200 cents. So we have 100 cents for each semi. Ok. And so here, the cool thing is that's obviously like there's a, as a threshold below which we can't just like really tell the difference between two pitches, but that threshold of so called noticeable pitch difference is between 10 and 25 cents depending like on who you are. Your, I guess your age and your background, if you are like a musician or you're not, probably if you're a musician, like you are capable of appreciating",

And finally, I want to remember uh that we have a community which is on a Slack workspace that's called the Sound of A I where if you join, you're gonna be able to just like join the discussion, ask questions with the community. Get feedback and yeah. Happen to know like very cool people. OK. That's all for today. I hope I'll see you next time. Cheers.",
