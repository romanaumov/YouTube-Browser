We'll be looking at the math and theory behind it. And I'm also gonna give you the intuition. But before we get started, I want to remind you about the sound of A I is Luck community, which is a community of people who are interested in all things A I audio music and signal processing. So you can join, get feedback on your projects and network with very cool people. So if you haven't joined yet, I highly suggest you to go check out the sign up link in the description box below. But now let's move on to the cool stuff. So in the last couple of videos, we looked into mal frequency subs coefficients or MF CCS. And now it's time to move on to frequency domain audio features and we can do this because now if you followed along with the series,",

And so we know how to move to the frequency domain today, we'll be looking into three frequency domain audio features specifically, these are the band energy ratio, the spectral centr and the bandwidth.

So we divide like this green power here by the uh the power here like in this uh blue bar and that is the band energy ratio. Ok. So what can we use the band to energy ratio for? Well, we can use it for all sorts of things uh in music and speech processing and specifically band energy ratio has been extensively used in to discriminate music from speech and for certain music classification problems like music genre classification or mood uh classification.

But now with this idea in mind and with this basic understanding, you can go there and you can easily understand all the other ones that are out there. So what's up next? Well, we talked about the theory behind this uh frequency domain audio features in this video. Next, we're gonna be implementing uh one of these audio features from scratch and that's the band energy ratio and we use Python for doing that as we've done throughout this series. And then we're going to be visualizing the uh band energy ratio for pieces of music in different genres and try to understand if we can tell them apart based only on the band energy uh ratio.",
