                "transcript": "Hey everybody and welcome to a new exciting video and the audio signal processing for machine learning series. This time we'll be looking into mel spectrograms. This is a flavor of spectrograms that is extensively used in A I audio research and A I audio real world applications. But before we get started into mel spectrograms, I want to give you an overview of what we did over the last couple of videos and that is the short time fourier transform. And we also looked into extracting and visualizing spectrograms. Now, if you're not familiar with this concept, I highly suggest you to go check out my previous two videos, cos what I'm going to say next in the video builds on top of this two notions extensively. Now without further ado let's move on to this visualization of a spectrogram. And as you can see here on the X axis, we have time on the Y axis. As usual we have uh frequency and each point which is represented by a color in this two D representation uh tells us how present a certain frequency is at each point in time. The thing that I want you to understand here is that the frequency representation with a normal vanilla spectrum is leaner and it uses Hertz. And this is kind of problematic in terms of like the way we perceive frequency. Now, I just, I don't just want to tell you that I want to show you that and to show you that I, we're gonna do like a little psychotic experiment. So we have a couple of audio samples. So each of these has a pair of notes. So in the first one, we have C two that moves to C four, C four being the middle C note. So the C note at the center of a piano keyboard. And the second, for example, we have G six that goes up to A six. Now if you take a look at the difference in the frequency mapping or in other words, in the uh frequency expressed in Hertz between the two NS in the two paths, you'll notice that more or less like these two differences are the same or almost the same. And that is around 200 Hertz. But will these two pair of notes like sounds the same in terms of like their pitch distance? So this is my question to you. OK. So let's listen to these two pairs of notes. The first one, C two to C four. OK. The second one G six J A six. OK. I'm sure you'll agree with me that the second sample has the two notes that are way closer in pitch than the first two notes. And this is a little bit weird, isn't it? Right. So the difference in frequency as expressed in Hertz is actually the same. But that isn't true from a perceptual perspective because like the the second pair of notes uh sound way closer in pitch than the first two. This basically means that the way we perceive pitch is non linear and indeed, we have way better resolution at lower frequencies than we have at higher frequencies specifically. What happens is that humans perceive frequency longer rhythmically. And this is a, a little bit of a problem that we have with vanilla spectrograms. And that's because as I said, frequency is expressed linearly in uh row like or vanilla spectrograms. And so we don't account for the way we human beings perceive it. Now, let's think about an ideal audio feature that we would like to have and would make the most sense uh to fit to our own like machine learning and deep learning algorithms. Well, first of all, we want some kind of a time frequency representation because we want to know how the different frequencies in a signal evolve over time. Then we want for this F to F to have perceptually relevant amplitude representation. And this once again is because amplitude and the way we perceive it is logarithmic N it's not uh linear, right. And both of these things we can achieve with vanilla spectrograms. And indeed, we have like a lot amplitude spectrograms as we say in the uh previous video. But what we can't achieve with vanilla spectrograms is the third aspect which is perceptually relevant frequency representation. And this is what male spectrograms are all about, right? And they check out all of these three interesting um conditions but now male spectrograms. So it's a term, it's a concept with two words, one is spectrograms and by now, you should be more than familiar with it. The other one is male. So what is this thing? What's a male? Right? This concept is, is connected with the idea or, or concept of a male scale and the male scale is a perceptually relevant or perceptually informed scale for pitch. And here we have like a nice representation. So I suggest you like to focus on this graph right now. So on the X axis, we have frequency expressed in Hertz on the Y axis, we have frequency expressed in melts and this blue curve is just the mapping between Hertz and melts. And as you can see, it follows a logarithmic uh kind of like function curve. And indeed the males scale is a logarithmic in nature. And by being logarithmic, what it does is it becomes perceptually uh relevant, perceptually informed. And what does this mean? Really? Well, it means that equal distances on the scale have the same perceptual distance. OK. Let's try to, to understand this with an example. So let's say we have a couple of like pairs of notes. So the first one, uh the first part is 500 Hertz and five sorry, 500 melts and 510 melts. The second one is 1000 melts and 1010 melts. Now, the perceptual difference between these two, the two notes in the two pairs is the same. So the pitch distance is gonna be the same And that's obviously not true here for Hertz as we demonstrated with our little experiment earlier. OK. Now, one thing that we did that like researchers did with the males scale is that they standardize it. So that at 1000 Hertz, we have 1000 Hertz, we have 1000 males. Now you may be wondering but how did we arrive at such a perceptual scale? Well, we arrived it in an empirical way doing psychological experiment. Now what? And the last question you may have regarding like the the mouse scale is, where does the term like mel comes from? Well, Mel is an abbreviation for melody and melody, I mean, is very connected with the concept of pitch because pitch, I mean, is the main thing that you have in a melody along with rhythm, I would say and say like melody, Mel pitch. So you get the idea, right? OK. But uh now let's take a look at how we can move from uh the frequency expressed in Hertz to the frequency expressed in melt. And it's this like empirical uh like formula here as it said, like found by trial and error with experiments. And the important thing here, apart from all of this like um constants is like the logarithm that we use. And indeed, we have like this logarithm logarithmic kind of relationship. Now, we can take the inverse of this function. And with this, we're gonna be able to move from melts back to Hertz. Now, I want to just let you rem just like, yeah, keep in mind these two formulas because we're gonna be needing them like moving forward. OK. So now you should have like a basic idea of the male scale and why it is important in terms of like the way we perceive um music or not music, sorry we perceive pitch in this case. OK. But uh how does this relate to the male spectrograms? OK. And here I'll give you a kind of recipe for extracting mel spectrograms and this recipe has three steps. So the first thing that we do is we extract the short time for transform. And the second thing is to convert the amplitude to decibels. In other words, uh like we take like some kind of like logarithmic representation of amplitude. Now, as I said, these two steps are like the ones that we use for vanilla spectrogram. So nothing new here. The new thing is the third step here which is converting frequencies to the melt scale. So this is like the whole point of male spectrograms. So we take a spectrogram and then we convert the frequencies in that spectrogram to the male frequency uh representation. OK. So the next question is how do we do that? Well, uh we for converting like this frequent to the male scale, we have a bunch of like steps. Um It's like these three steps here. So we choose the number of male bands. First, we compute the male filter banks. Now don't be scared about like this scary word, male filter banks because I'll show you what this like in a few minutes. And finally, we want to apply the male filter banks to the spectrograms. OK? And now I'm going to break down each of these steps for you so that it becomes like super clear how to do this. OK? So let's start with the first thing. So choosing the number of male bands. Well, the first of all, so male bands. So when you're just like reading some research, say in a audio or music information retrieval and researchers are using uh male spectrograms, one fundamental parameter that you have is the number of male bands, right? And uh that is like a parameter that can vary. So the question is like, how many male bands like should you pick? Well, 40 it's totally fine. 60 is fine. Sometimes you find numbers like uh close to 90 or even 100 and 28. The reality is it really depends on the problem. The reason like one single answer to this question, it's a little bit when you ask. OK. So what's learning rate should you use? Well, there isn't just like one answer. You have to try out different stuff and see what works best. And indeed, the number of male bands is a hyper parameter that you can vary and see the impact that it has on your algorithms and your deep learning algorithms. But all in all you see that usually like the the numbers that we have is between I would say like 40 100 and 20 100 and 30 like maximum. And I mean, one thing like that's uh a little heuristic here is that if you think about the number of notes, for example, that we have on a piano keyboard, uh that is like 88 right? Um That is kind of like the way like we tend to like resolve like frequencies and we represent them. Now, the idea of a male band is like kind of like a a range of frequencies like that are like perceptually relevant. So I would expect like that this number like makes sense because like they kind of look close to like the notes that we usually experience like for example, like on, on our like western uh music. So these types of numbers like make sense for that because they are comparable, they have like the same order of magnitude as the number of notes that we usually experience. OK, good. So now we know uh like what numbers of male banks like to choose from? More or less. Now, the next step is to actually construct the male filter banks. And here we like, understand what these male bands are. OK. So how do we construct the male filter bands? Well, this is a kind of like a quite complex process or it's not really that complex. It's more like it's a multi step process. It has like five different steps. And so I'm gonna break down all of these five steps for you. I'm not gonna get too much into sorry the math here. Nor am I gonna like implement it. But I highly suggest you to try to implement all of these steps that I'm just gonna uh talk about in a theoretical way because that is a very good exercise to see whether like you understand all of these steps uh precisely. OK. So how do we build like this male filter banks? Well, first of all, we take a lowest and highest frequency like in the frequency range and like in the short time four transform that we've just kind of like extracted and then we convert the lowest and highest frequency to a male representation. How do we do that? Well, we use like this little formula that we already encountered before when talking about the male scale. OK. So now we have like the lowest and highest frequency that we want to consider expressed in melts next step. So now uh given like we've already chosen the number of mel bands that we want to use like for our mel spectrogram. The next step is to take like the um the frequency range in terms of like male, the lowest mail, like over here, the highest male here. And then we want to create as many uh points, equally spaced points as the number of male bands that we want to use. In other words. So this is gonna be like very simple, like to visualize. Uh So let's say like we have like six mel bands, we want to use six mel bands. So what we'll do uh if this is like the lowest uh male frequency and this is the highest male frequency, we'll just like take this point here. So we'll just create this six points and they'll be equally spaced in this uh frequency uh range here. OK. Now, what we are going to do next is quite simple really is basically just like converting this points back to Hertz by using this function here that we found when we were talking about the uh male scale. Now, if you're wondering about this melt point, this points, so what are they? Well, they are the center of the different mel bands. OK. They are the center frequency of the different mel bands that we are talking about here. OK. And we'll see this like uh with a visualization in a couple of moments. OK. Next step. So we've now converted back like this uh center frequency points where are like Melbournes back to Hertz. And now what we want to do is we want to round this points to the nearest frequency bin. So why is this like important we say, why do we need to do that? Well, it's because we are dealing with uh discrete uh signals. And that means that we don't have like infinite perfect resolution like on the frequency and actually like a resolution is somewhat like constrained by the frame size, the short time fourier transform. So what that basically means is that when we'll get back to uh the this like center uh frequency uh points, we we can't just like take them like as they are, we need to like bin them and we need to just like round them to the nearest like frequency bin that we have available, right? And finally, we have the, the, the last step which probably is the most important, which is like creating triangular filters. And this triangular filters are basically are the the kind of like the building blocks of a male filter bank. And they are connected with this idea of the different like male bands. So I'll visual visualize what these things are. And then I'll explain how we get like this visualization here. So don't be scared about like all of this complexity because it's way easier than it looks like. OK. So here on the X axis, we have the frequency in the bottom is expressed in huts in the top. Here is expressed in Mels. And here on the Y axis, we have weight and weight is between one and zero. Mm Why do we have a weight there? Well, because these are filters, basically what they do is they just like tend to filter sound and when you have a weight equal to one, you're not touching like that uh signal. But uh with a weight below one, what you are doing is just like ding down kind of like dumping the um the uh the signal, right? Because you're scaling it with a value that's below one, right? OK. So now, as you can see here, we, we have an example which like six mel bands. OK. And here indeed, you have like six points like overall and so these are the center frequencies for our six male bands. OK. And so uh let's take, for example, like this second point here. So this is, let's say like it's at 2000 Hertz which is 1526 males. OK. So what you can notice here is that's the difference between uh all the, the center points for the male bands. I is the same uh when it's calculated in male. So we basically have always like the same difference between like two subsequent um two subsequent like center frequency uh points. But this is not true in the case of Hertz. And that's the whole point, right? That's the whole point because uh which are like frequency expressed in Hertz. When we go like towards higher frequencies, we have to just like spread out the frequencies uh to have like the same perceptual uh difference in terms of like a frequency distances. OK. But now let's focus only like on constructing a single uh triangular filter for one male band. OK. So let's stick like this point. Uh um male bench number two here. So the center of this male band, as we said is 1000 or 1526 mels and then the lower end and the higher end uh so are taken by respectively taking the center of the previous male band and the center frequency of the subsequent male band. And for the lower end and the higher end of a male band, we have a weight which is like equal to zero. So in other words, like uh below this uh frequency, the lower end frequency uh like we are not gonna have so the, the signal is completely muted, it put to zero, same thing here for the frequencies above the higher range uh here. OK. And now what we do is we kind of like trace a line between the lower and the higher end and we connect that with the center frequency where the weight is equal to one. And so if we do that, we actually build a triangular filter like this. Now, if you do the same thing uh again, for the third Melba band, 4th, 5th and 6th, well, you just come up with the whole male filter bank, right? And these are triangular filters. OK? And so I hope lucky you now have like an understanding of like what a male filter bank is and the whole purpose of this beast is that then we can just like apply this to uh like a normal spectrogram. And then we can filter out like the different frequencies and convert them like to normal frequencies in huts to frequencies expressed in males. OK? But here we have just like a visualization of a male filter bank but uh obviously like in digital signal processing as well as like in machine learning. We we don't do operations with visualizations. We we actually use math and linear algebra uh like most of the time, right? And so what this means is that we can represent this male filter bank using metrics or a two dimensional array and the shape of these metrics uh is gonna be like this. So like the number of rows that we're gonna have like in a male filter band is equal to the number of bands that we chose. In our example, it's gonna be equal to six, so six rows and then the uh number of columns that we have is equal to the ini frequency or in other words, frame size divided by two plus one. And so this is like the um metrics that we'll be using for representing a male filter bank. OK. So I hope you now have an understanding like of this male filter bank. And then now with all of this information, we need to go like to the final step in the conversion from frequencies to males scale for our spectrogram. In other words, we are actually moving from the spectrogram to the male spectrograms. And how do we do that? Well, we have to apply the male filter banks to the spectrogram. And how do we do that? And here linear algebra can help us quite a lot. OK. So here we have like the, the shape of the male filter bank uh matrix. And now here we have the shape of another matrix and this is the matrix associated to a spectrogram. So if you follow it along like uh my last couple of videos, you know, now that the the shape of a spectrogram, uh the shape of a matrix that represents the spectrogram is given like by these numbers here. So the number of columns that we have sorry, the number of rows that we have in the spectrogram is equal to the unique frequency uh plus one and the number of columns is given by the number of frames or in other words like the temporal bins. Now. So we, we said that the whole point here is to apply male filter banks to spectrum. What does that mean? So that must mean something in a mathematical way. Well, if you're familiar with linear algebra, you've probably noticed something interesting about these two matrices. And that's that the number of columns of the first matrix or the male filter bank uh matrix is equal to the number of rows of the um matrix that represents uh the spectrogram. So when this happens, it means that we can do apply like matrix multiplication. OK. So in other words, applying male filter banks to spectrograms from mathematical standpoint means multiplying doing like matrix multiplication between the uh male filter banks and the spectrogram. The result of this multiplication is the male spectrogram. Now, I'm not gonna get into the details of this matrix multiplication because it's outside the scope of this series. But if you're interested and you don't know that much about linear algebra, I have a video over here that you can check out where I talk about uh basic operations with uh like matrices. And, and one of those is actually matrix multiplication. OK. So now uh let's take a look at the mel spectrogram. So the mel spectrogram is a metric, a metric itself and its shape is given by the number of bands. So we have like the as many number of as many rows as the number of bands that we chose and uh on, on the number of columns that we have is equal to the number of frames of the original spectrograms. OK. So in other words, if you think about this like this uh multiplication here, so applying male filter banks to the spectrogram, what enabled us to do is basically to convert the frequencies just from Hertz to male bands. OK. And that's the whole point of a male spectrogram. And the cool thing now is that we are, we are using uh male bands which are kind of psychologically uh relevant in terms of the way we perceive pitch. OK. But now let's take a look at what this means in terms of like a visual representation. And well, if you're familiar with spectrograms, well, mouse spectrograms are no different at all. Uh So you still have a uh hit map. And that's because we have like a uh a matrix, right? And on the X axis, we have like time on the Y axis. Once again, we have frequency. But this time like the different frequency bins are not uh like the linear bins that we use with the spectrum, but rather the uh male bands, each frequency B is a different male band which is perceptually relevant. And then each um point that we have here has a, an associated uh color that represents how present a certain Melba is at a certain point in time. So basically, the conceptual understanding or visualization uh of males spec spectrograms is the same that we had for spectrograms. The only thing that really differs here is the way we represent a frequency which is like pitch uh like psychologically relevant this time different differently from uh a spectrogram. OK. So uh the last question that we might ask here is why should we both like learning about male spectrograms? So and the the answer to this question is that they are extensively used in a lot of A I audio and A I music research. So a lot of papers that you may be reading about like audio classification uses M spectrograms. This is very, very true also for a lot of like music information retrieval A I music uh papers. So for example, math spectrograms are overwhelmingly used like in automatic minute recognition, music genre classification, music, instrument classification and way more applications we have for this type of uh spectrograms. OK. But uh this time we only focused on the theory of male spectrograms. And I hope that by now you have like a clear understanding of like what male males are, the male representation and why like male spectrograms are different than spectrograms and why they are very convenient uh like to use in a lot of like the applications where like we're talking about audio and music. Uh So the next time we'll be moving to actual some kind of like implementation. So we'll be trying, we'll be extracting mouse spectrograms uh from audio files using Python. And Lisa and Lisa has a lot of like very nice utility functions that we can use that will save us a lot of time. And then we'll visualize male spectrograms and then we'll also try to extract and visualize male filter bands so that you can actually understand and see how we can. Yeah, just like we represent them and what they actually represent. OK. Before I dash off and I finish, uh I want to remind you about the Sound of the Ice Lack community. And there if you have like any questions about like this stuff, your projects and way more stuff regarding like A I audio in A I music, you can just ask and there you'll have like a community of people interested in A I audio A IUS audio processing that are really like to help you really like to share like their ideas, their projects. So I really suggest you to go check out this community and I'll give you the link to uh sign up to the Slack community in the description below. Uh It's all for today. I hope you really enjoyed the video and I guess I'll see you next time. Cheers."
