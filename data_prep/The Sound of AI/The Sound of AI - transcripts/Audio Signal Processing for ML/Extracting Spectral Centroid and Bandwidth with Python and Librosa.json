                "transcript": "Hi, everybody and welcome to a new video in the audio signal processing for machine learning series. This is not only a new video but it's gonna be the last one in the series. So what I'm gonna do today is basically show you how you can calculate the spectral Centroid and the spectral bandwidth using libres. OK. So let's get started. So here, as you can see, I already fired up a notebook and wrote down like some stuff. So I'm not gonna go through this like in detail because we've seen this time and again, time and again throughout the series. But basically, so we have like all sorts of imports here with Lisa and other stuff that we'll use here. We are loading some audio files and we are always using the free usual audio files. So the bey piece, an orchestral piece, then a song by Red Hot Chili Peppers and then a nice ballad by Jake Eton. So this is a jazzy music. So here I just like display all of them. I'm not gonna play us back because like we've heard them like multiple times and if you're interested, you can download the uh the network and hear for yourself. And then what I do here, I load all the audio files with LIB browser so that we get both the uh the signal as a non power and the sample rate. OK. So it's now time to calculate the spectral Centroid with libros. Now, the first thing that we want to do is just like uh set up the uh frame size and the hop length. And we're gonna need uh these values for extracting the spectral Centroid. OK. So now let's move on and uh actually extract the spectral Centroid. So we'll do a SC, this is like uh stands for spectral uh Centroid and we'll do uh the BC over here. And uh so what we'll do is a lib rosa dot feature and then we'll get the spectral Centroid feature and here we should pass uh a few arguments. So the first of which is just the signal itself. So we'll do A Y which stands for signal uh for in Lisa. And here we'll pass the, the BC signal, so we'll pass the BC, then we want to pass the sample rate and we know that this is equal to SR because we took it here, then uh we need to pass the frame size that's called N dash N underscore FFT. Uh And so this is gonna be equal to the frame size. And finally, we'll pass in the H length that's equal to the constants that we uh just like sat over here. OK. So uh let me just do the same thing for the three other signals that we have. So for the red hot chili peppers and for uh for the two other signals that we have. So red hot chili pepper song and Jake song. So this one, I, I'll just call uh red hots and let me pass this guy over here as the signal and then we'll do ISC, the spectral Centroid of Duke and I'll pass the signal for GKL inter over here. So if I don't have any mistakes, so we should just like run this and get the spectral cent, right. Yeah, it seems like it works. Let's now calculate the shape of the features that we just got. So we can do SC uh the BC dot uh shape. And as you can see here, we have a bi dimensional array. The first dimension is equal to one and the second dimension is equal to uh 1292. So the second dimension is equal to the number of frames uh that we get to say it's all like the, we are like in the time domain and it's all the, the frames that we have there. OK. But we are mainly interested like in those uh 1292 values of the spectral cent across time. So what we should do here is just get item zero over here. So let's do that. And if we rerun this, as you can see, obviously here, we are just getting like a one dimensional array which this almost 1300 values. And that is like the value for each frame, the value of the spectral cent for frame. The next thing that we want to do is to visualize the spectral center right across time for the three pieces of music. OK. So let's start by just creating some markdowns say spectral Centroid. OK. So here, so how do we do this? Well, we'll use map plot Libs. So the first thing that we'll do is plots dot uh figure. So we'll create a figure with a given fig size figure size and this is gonna be equal to uh 15 or like, yeah, let's say 25 by 10. And then we want to move on and here start adding uh like the curve. So we're gonna have like a single figure with three different curves for the three different pieces that we are analyzing. OK. So we'll do a plots dot plots. And here we need to pass the value for the X axis, the Y axis and a color. OK. So for the X axis, we need to pass time. So I haven't still, I calculated that. So yeah, I'll do that like once we have like all of this ready, the for the Y axis, obviously, what we want to pass is the, the values of the spectral Centroid uh And finally, we want to pass the uh a color. And so for the BC, we'll use a blue. Now, let's just add the same thing. But for the other uh songs, so we'll have like the red hot chili pepper song here and this is gonna be a red and finally, we'll have like the Duke Ellington uh piece and this is gonna be uh yellow like this. And finally, we'll do a plot dot uh show. Now, as I said, uh we still don't have time. Uh So we need just like to, to, to create that. And so we'll create that starting from the frame start by getting the frames and we can easily get, get them by doing the length of, well, the range of the length of any of these uh spectral Centroid features. We'll do, yeah, we'll take uh the spectral centro uh feature for the BC and we can't use any of this because they all have like the original signals all have the same uh duration. So they'll have like the, the same number of frames. OK. So, and then we can build uh time here. And so we'll do a li li browser dot frames to uh time. And here we should just pass the frames like this. OK. Let's do this and see if it works well. I have an error. So yeah, this is not figi size but it is fig size. So yeah, let's work this out. OK. Nice. OK. So here we have the uh yeah a graph with the three curves for the spectral Centroid uh for like Duke Allington for the red hot chili peppers as well as for uh the D BC orchestral piece. So on the X axis, we have time and as you can probably see it's difficult but it's there, we have 30 so this is like 30 seconds worth data of like a piece. And then here like on the Y axis, we just have the value of the spectral Centroid. And as you can see the spectral Centroid for the red hot chili peppers is overall like higher across time than the same for uh the Beau C which is like this curve in blue. And for the Duke Ellington piece, uh now, uh this is something that is usually the case. So usually like which rock music you or like EDM popular music, you tend to have spectral cent rates that are like a little bit higher than uh the other like pieces that are that use tend to use like acoustic instruments like classical music or like jazz. OK. So uh now, of course, like if you don't remember like what the spectral cent is, I highly suggest you to Coche couch like this video will explain like what the spectral centro is. But in a nutshell, we are talking about the center of gravity, see the frequency, that's the main center of gravity for a piece and it's calculated like for each frame. And so here we have just like a curve that goes through the whole duration of the signal. And at each frame we're getting a value for the spectral Centroid. OK. So now we can move on uh to the spectral bandwidth and we can calculate it with uh libros. So let me just write some mark down here just to keep things neat. So we'll say spectral or yeah, let's say just like calculate uh band with OK. And so here I can easily calculate all of this. And so I can just like copy the stuff that we use for uh the spectral Centroid. And here instead of like cool the spectral Centroid function in a libres do feature I can call the spectral underscore bandwidth. That's all I need to do. And now magically, I'm gonna get the spectral bandwidth, obviously, I need to change like the the name of this variable because we're not dealing with spectral cent but with a spectral uh bandwidth. And so I can just like put uh yeah, let's put band which stands for bandwidth and we'll do the same thing for the red hot chili peppers signal and for the gig Allinson signal and we need to change this thing to bandwidth, same thing down here. And the rest uh remains the same because the arguments to spectral bandwidth are the same as we use for the spectral center. So the signal itself the sampling rate, the frame size and the hop length. And yeah, we need to always like take the the the first item. So the item zero and once we do this, OK. So here we have like the um the the spectral bandwidth like for all of these three signals. Now let's take a look at the shape. And here once again, you should have yes, this 1292. And this is like a one dimensional ray once again because we are taking like the item, the the zero item here, right? And this is like equal. So basically what this means is that we have a value for the bandwidth for each frames uh that we are analyzing. OK. So now let's move on and just visualize this. And once again, we are gonna basically reuse the kit that we just wrote. So we'll do visualize uh band with OK, like this. And then I'm just gonna get this stuff over here and we can reuse this. And so I'll use the instead of like the spectral centr the BC, I'm passing the, the bandwidth for the beauty for the red hot chili peppers and for Duke Ellington like this. And now tea remains the same because and well, I I ask you first thing so just like post the video and just like think about why a tea for the bandwidth is the same as the one that we have for the spectral cent, I'll give you a couple of seconds. Well, the the answer is, is super easy and that's because uh the, the shape is the same if, if you take a look at this, right. So the shape, so the number of frames that we have like for the bandwidth are the same number of frames uh that we have like for the uh spectral Centroid. So we can use like the same X axis. So we are using like the same times. OK. So now let's just uh plot this and as you can see, yeah, we have like a nice uh yeah, the three curves that more or less like resemble uh like the, the ones that we have for the spectral Centroid. And uh that's because like in a sense like the bandwidth is derived from the spectral uh Centroid and it gives us basically like the amount of frequencies that are like relt there are significant around the spectral uh Centroid and the, the the kind of like comment that we can apply to this plot. And to uh yeah, I would say like to the spectral bandwidth is similar to the one that we had regarding the spectral Centroid in a sense like the spectral bandwidth of uh acoustic pieces like classical music or uh jazz music tends to be like smaller than the one that we have for. Um yeah, rock music or yeah, music which like electronic instruments usually or percussions for sure. OK. So yeah, this is it. So now you are able to calculate the spectral centro and the bandwidth using uh Liza. And yeah, I think like that's it for like this video and I just wanted to yeah close like this series like with a few uh with a couple of comments. So one thing I think like this was like an amazing ride. So we went through a lot of things and if you follow it along with like my series now, yeah, you have like a very strong background in audio processing and audio uh features for machine learning. So you now know about the difference of like time domain features, frequency domain features. You should have a very good understanding of the fourier transform and uh great understanding about MF CCS uh male spectrograms, spectrograms, uh log spectrograms. And so these are all ingredients that are will be necessary for your activity as an A I audio or A I music engineer or researcher. So yeah, congratulate like yourself because you did a lot of stuff if you follow it uh so far. And then a final like personal l like I was very happy with all the the feedback that I got the questions that you guys like asked throughout the series. It was like amazing also like the the feedback that I got like on the sound of the eyes like channel. By the way, if you want to sign up to that community you have the uh sign up link in the description box below. So yeah, I hope like uh I can continue to produce, I will continue to produce like content like this and get like uh feedback, positive like feedback uh from you. And yeah, I think like that's all for today. If you enjoyed the video, the series and you haven't like subscribed yet to the sign of VA channel, please consider doing so. And uh if you like the video just hit the like button and I guess I'll see you in the next series. Cheers."
