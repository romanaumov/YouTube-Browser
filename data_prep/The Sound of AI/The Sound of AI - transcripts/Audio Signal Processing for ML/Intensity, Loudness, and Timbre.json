                "transcript": "Hi, everybody and welcome to another video in the audio processing for machine learning series. Last time we talked about basic features of sounds. So what sound is waveforms and introduce the concept of frequency. This time we continue delving into the features of sound, talking about intensity, power, loudness and timbre. So first of all, I want to talk about two, a couple of concepts. So intensity and power and these are like connected together. So let's start from the power of sound. Well, this is we all know how the power of sound, right? But we don't want to talk about the power of sound here. We actually want to talk about the reverse of that, the sound power. So what's the sound power? Well, this is a physical that we can express like this. It's basically the rate at which the energy is transferred. This is basically the idea of the concept of a power in general. But if we talk about sound power specifically, this is the energy per unit of time emitted by a sound source in all directions across, I mean like the air across like the the medium uh that the sound is troubling in and we measure power in watts, OK. And we indicate that with a capital W OK. So this is like the idea of sound uh power. Now connected with sound power, we have another uh thing that's called sound intensity. And sound intensity is simply sound power per unit area, right? And we can measure that as what's divided by squared meters. OK. So the higher like the intensity and obviously the higher the kind of like perception like of loudness of that sound that we we're gonna have. OK. So now I'm going to ask you like a question. So how much power do you think I thunder like a super heavy thunder has or how much power do you think I a concert orchestra has? Well, you may think like quite a lot, right? Because like we perceive it as very loud, definitely like the the heavy thunder, right? And it gave us like a few scares like, I guess in the past when we were a child, OK. But uh that's not really the case. So both a concert orchestra and a heavy thunder usually have a sound power of one watt. Now, if you are not familiar with like any reference like with water, I'm gonna give you one. So your usual like a light bulb uh used to be 100 watts. OK. So like a whole orchestra is uh 1/100 basically of a light bulb in terms of like power, same thing for this heavy thunder. So, yeah, this is like quite mesmerizing, isn't it? Ok. But basically this tells us another very interesting thing, uh which is connected with a concept called the threshold of hearing. So humans are capable of perceiving sounds which have extremely small uh intensities and the threshold of hearing is at 10 to the minus 12 watt uh over squared meters, right? So this is like an extremely small number, but still we're capable like of hearing that. So obviously like the threshold of hearing like is the minimum intensity of sound that we can appreciate. OK. So now uh another uh kind of threshold which is like very important for us is called the threshold of pain. So which is like the the threshold beyond which we start to have like a hearing pain, right? Because like the sound like a uh is like too intense. OK. And that's it at 10 um the watts over squared meters. So if you just like uh calculate the difference between 10 to the minus 12 and 10, you appreciate that like the amount the range of intensity that we can perceive is enormous. It's basically like 13 orders of magnitude, which is incredible. And that's why we use uh the so called intensity level, like for describing the um the intensity of the sound. And that's why we put the intensity level on a logarithmic scale because like the range like it's really, really enormous and the intensity level is connected with this um measure which we call with this unit of measure, which we call decibels. I'm sure like you may be familiar with this, but you may be wondering, uh you may have wondered, ok, but what's the decibel? Well, it's a measure of intensity level and it's a ratio between two in intensity values. I just like check found that I have like a small like typo here. It's not ration because I don't know what that is, but it's a ratio between two intensity values, right? And so we use an intensity of reference which sometimes is the threshold of hearing. And then we compare that against um a current uh like intensity and we applied that ratio uh a logarithm. And so if we want to take a look at the um function that describe decibels as a function of intensity is this one right? So we have 10 by log of a intensity divided by the intensity of the threshold of hearing. OK. Cool. OK. So now you may be wondering but what's zero decibels? And so for that we need to pass in uh the intensity of the threshold of hearing. And so if we do that this ratio uh basically like goes down to uh to one and logarithm or one is equal to zero. So we multiply 10 by zero which is zero. OK. So a zero at zero decibel, we are basically appreciating the uh density of the threshold of hearing. Now, this is not a universal because it really depends on the uh kind of like reference intensity that you use in the intensity level. But usually like, you'll find a lot of people like using the threshold of hearing like as a, as an intensity, um a level of reference. OK. So another thing uh to notice about the intensity level is that every time we go up by three decibels, the intensity tends to uh double. So if we are at zero decibel, we are at the um uh intensity of like the threshold of hearing. But if we go up by three, we are just like doubling uh that uh intensity cool. OK. So now I want to show you a cool table which by the way is, but uh I, like I took it from a book which is an amazing book like on audio music processing that's called Fundamentals of Music pro Assessing it. It's by Mueller. So many of the uh like uh pictures like graphs and tables I'm gonna use here are just like taken from that book. And I highly suggest you to go check that out because it's great and it will give you like way more context that what I'm covering here. OK. But here you have a table where we have a lot of like different sound sources and we have like the intensity measured in watts over a squared meters. The and the relative intensity uh level and the uh re that like compared in, in terms of like the threshold of hearing, OK. So like when we whisper, we have an intensity which is at 10 to the minus uh 10, which is basically a 20 decibels. So a normal conversation happens at an intensity of 10 to the minus six which is 60 decibels and the uh threshold of pain, which is, we know is already uh intensity 10, it's 100 and 30 decibels and the jet. So when you have like a jet engine, a take off, this is at intensity 10 to 2 and it's 100 and 40 decibels. OK. So this gives you like more or less like an idea of like the different sounds and the relative intensity. But now let's move on to another aspect that I think like it's extremely fascinating, which is loudness now, while in intensity and power are to objective measures, loudness is a subjective measure of intensity. It is really like how loud we perceive a sound. And as we've seen for um a frequency pitch which is like the relative like um kind of like subjective measure of frequency, obviously, it it correlates with frequency, but like there's some level of like uh subjectivity and some level of like mapping that's not like linear, not the direct and the same thing happens here between intensity and loudness. OK. So um loudness. So first of all, uh depends on duration and the frequency of the sound in terms of duration. So we usually hear as at, at equal intensity, we hear shorter sounds as less loud than longer sounds. So for example, if I have a sound which is at uh say three decibels and it only lasts for 100 milliseconds. I'll hear that as less loud than a similar sound with the same three decibel intensity level, but which lasts for 600 milliseconds. So this is like kind of like very fascinating because at the end of the day, the intensity is the same, but the perception of loudness is different and a similar thing happens also with frequency. So frequency, depending on which frequency the sound is, we're gonna hear that sound at a different loudness level and obviously loudness is also correlated with age. So people of different age are gonna hear uh like sound with same intensity but like with different loudness, right? And for loudness. So what um researchers have done is basically they went out there and they did a lot of experiments to understand how we perceive uh sound and measured that with psychological experiments. And they came out with this measure UNICEF measure called fonts. So now let's take a look at fonts. So here you have a very interesting chart that's called like equal, equal, equal loudness content. So now on the y axis, you have the sound pressure level measured in decibels. So that's the intensity level here on the X axis, you have um frequency in a logarithmic scale. And it's measured obviously in Hertz, you should know that by now. And here like this curves that you see like in a ranch. So these are called equal loudness contours. So along these curves, we hear a sound to at a same intensity. So for example, on this curve here, we hear sound at 80 fonts, which basically is like we, we hear it at the same perceived loudness. However, what changes is the intensity level across the frequencies? So for example, when we are like at a very low frequency, say 20 Hertz, we need a lot of intensity. So 100 and 20 decibels to perceive that sound at 80 forms. But then when we go up say to 1000 uh Hertz, then to perceive that sound at 80 forms, we need way uh less intense of sound, which is around 80 decibels. And so which basically means that uh like at lower frequencies, we perceive sounds uh like as less loud if they are equal in intensity. And this is like interesting. And if you look at like where we are the most efficient with loudness here, uh it's around like from a few 100 Hertz up until like 5000, I would say 7000 Hertz, which is like more or less like the the range of like human speaking and human like singing, which may not be like a case at all. Right. So we are kind of like tailored to be the most efficient at that frequency range. And then like when the frequency goes up again. So we still uh yeah, we we are less efficient like at hearing sound at perceiving like the the loudness. And so we need more intensity to perceive like the same uh level of loudness. OK. So this is like extremely, extremely uh interesting and I am always like, fascinated about like the the correlation between like physical measures and um kind of like perceptual measures like and the way that these two things uh yeah, are connected together. And now we enter like yet another uh aspect of sound which is kind of like highly subjective and difficult to grasp and that's timer. OK. So what's Tre? Well, I wish we knew because like researchers interested in sound uh music and all of these kind of things like I've studied timbre like for a long time. Uh The problem is that we don't have like a real and comprehensive definition of timbre, but we have like a few hints. So uh if you uh ask a musician what Tre is like, they would probably tell you like it's the color of sound. But that's a weird definition like for some, something like which we hope like could be like a measurable thing, right? And but if we talk about this, like from a kind of like more like programmatic, like logical perspective, we could think of like a timer as the de between two sounds which have like all aspects equal, like in terms of like intensity, frequency and duration. So you do a diff and what remains like as uh sound there? Uh time bra sorry, it remains like time. Well, uh the point is like if you have like the, the same uh like notes like C five, for example, uh played on a trumpet, a trumpet and on a violin with the same intensity you still hear that there is a difference there. Uh But it's not intensity, it's not uh frequency, it's not duration, it's time breath. OK. So um and timbre is usually described with words like bright, dark, dull, harsh word. So all of this like sounds a little bit fuzzy, right? And that's because it is fuzzy, but now we don't know what a timer is perfectly, but we have a clear idea that Tre is somewhat multidimensional. So many features coming into place to define tre, this is different from other aspects of sounds like uh frequency or intensity. We just have like one like one measurable, one observable there. OK. So what are like some of these features that come into place which are timer? So here I've listed three which are like the most important ones. So one is called the sound envelope. Then we have the harmonic concepts and then amplitude and frequency modulation. Now, I'm quite sure that most of you are completely oblivious about like what these things are. But don't worry because I'm going to cover like all of these things uh uh in depth and we're gonna have like quite a lot of fun going through all of these aspects of sound. OK. So let's start with sound envelope, which is called also amplitude envelope. So what's that? Well, when we think of a sound definitely like this is true for like um musical sounds like notes and things like that on different instruments. So the sound usually has like a an envelope, right? And so this envelope can be divided with a model that's called the A DS R model which stands for attack decay sustain release model. So basically, the idea is that uh the amplitude of these sounds has an initial spike and that's like the attack. So for example, is when you strike a key on a piano, you have like a spike in amplitude which also has uh some kind of like noisy sounds due to the hummers like of the of the piano. And that's like a type of like transient sound. Then you have like a decay which is like where the sound like stabilizes a sustain a period which is like where the sounds like uh remains like more or less like constant in amplitude. And then you have a release which is like just like the fading out phase of a sound. Now, the interesting thing is that different types of like sounds have different envelopes and this is like definitely true for musical instruments. So let's take a look at this once again, I'm using like this uh figure from the Mueller's like book of fundamentals of music processing. OK. So here we can uh like um compare two different envelopes for a piano sound. So here, like you just like press a key and you wait for it like to, to just like decay and here you have violin sound, OK? And you see that the A DS R and the envelope of this key um sounds, it's like very, very different. So with the piano, you have like a short attack, a transient here, then you have like a little bit of a period of decay and then you have a sustain and finally you have a release down here, right? And uh this is different for, for violin as you can appreciate here, the attack is way longer in terms of time and that's because like the attack is less sharp. OK? Then you really don't have like a period of decay here. You just have like some kind of like sustain and then you have the release when uh yeah, just like end the sound. OK? So sound envelope is an important feature that determines the um the sound uh OK. So one thing that I, that I want to tell you here is that for example, if you remove the attack part from a key sound uh from a, from a piano uh sound. Um what happens is that it's difficult to recognize that that is like a, a piano that's uh like playing, right? That's because like we, we associate like a piano sound with its like sharp transient quite a lot. OK. So now let's move on to the second aspect which is harmonic content. But in order to understand how, what harmonic content is, we need to understand what a complex sound is made up of. So a complex sound is made up of a superposition of uh many S sinusoids or like fundamental uh like simple like sounds, right? So we can think of like a partial as a sinusoid, which is used to describe a sound. So uh the many different sinusoids that we have uh can, which are superimposed together to create a complex sound are called partials or harmonic partials. So the lowest partial is called the fundamental uh frequency. And this is it, this is usually like the one that gives the, the pitch name to a note. We are, we, we are talking about like a note, for example, musical note and now the harmonic partial. Um uh so, so the harmonic partials are frequency frequencies that are like a an integer multiple of the fundamental frequency. So let's say we have a fundamental frequency which is at 440 Hertz which is a uh four. Now, if we, if we uh take a look at the second partial there. So harmonic partial, what happens is that we have to multiply that 440 by two. And this gives us like 880 Hertz. Now the third partial will be three multiplied by 440 which is um 1320 Hertz. Now, you can move on. And basically, the idea is that like the complex sound is gonna made up of all of these like partials and the harmonic content tells us how much energy we have in each of these uh partials. And that determines somehow the temper of the sound. Now, not all sounds are perfectly harmonic. So there's a lot of in harmonic in some sounds and that uh we determine in harmonic, we indicate at the cation from a harmonic partial. So that's for example, if uh we had like some frequencies that are not perfect harmonic partials of the fundamental frequency. Now, if we take a look at music instruments, for example, we know that um pitched, pitched instruments tend to be like harmonic, whereas like percussive instruments tend to have a lot of in harmonic, right? So, and usually obviously like noise are, are highly completely like in harmonic, right? Cool. So this gives you like a an idea. But now let's try to like listen to some of these things. So for showing uh the harmonic content, we should go and check out like a Jupiter Notebook that I just like uh OK. So here I'm not gonna go through like the code because like the the point here is not like to show you like some of these things because we're gonna cover them like in future videos anyways. But I want to, to, to show you like some sounds and then the relative spectrograms. OK. So yeah, so here just like I learn some sounds and here like I have like a nice function that I can use to plot a spectrogram. Now, what's the spectrogram? So you'll hear about this like a lot moving forward. But basically, the idea is that with a spectrogram, we get a snapshot of, of like the different energy in different frequencies of a sound across the duration of that sound. And we can visualize that with a nice um plot, which is this one. OK. So now let's try to um uh listen to a sound. And so here, what I want to show you like is two sounds and we'll start with a violin sound uh which is at uh I believe at uh C four. OK. So that's middle C and so let's listen to this sound. OK. Yeah, let's OK. Good. So that's C four on a um violin. OK. So now let's plot the spectrogram for this and here you have it OK? In all of its glory. So basically the idea here is that on the X axis you have time measured usually in seconds on the y axis, you have Hertz and this is like a logarithmic scale. And here, like each point here has a color and the color tells you, uh, like the uh intensity of a, um, yeah, of that frequency at that like specific time. And so here, like you have this color bar that tells you like how to read like the intensity based on color, like the redder and the more intense like the that frequency is OK. So as you can see here, so we, we have uh a lot of like energy here in, at days like frequency band, which is around 256 precisely. This is a 261 which I believe like should be like the Hertz for CF four, the frequency for C four. And yes. And here we expect a lot of energy. But then we have like the, the, the partial, the harmonic partial here, which is double that frequency, which is a 500 to 12. And as you can see here, we have like uh that coming in and then we multiply 256 S 61 by three and we have the third partial and you can see it here, the fourth, the fifth cool, it's super cool and you can go up and up and up and up and you still get like all of these partials. OK. And so uh as you can see, there's not much like in harmonic here. So the partials like are very well defined here. OK. So now let's compare this with a piano sound. OK. So now I have, I believe like it's ac five piano sound. So let's listen now. OK. So you, you heard that? So this is C five. So it's an octave above uh the violin sound that we just heard. And so let's take a look at the um um at the spectrum here for this piano sound. And so, as you can see here, we have a lot of activity uh around 512. And this is like a correct, right? Because this is like the fundamental frequency that we expect at um C five. And then over here you have like the first uh like har like partial, you go up the second, the third, the fourth. But as you can see the, the higher you go and the less presence like the partials are. And if you compare this like against this, right, you see the difference, OK. So this is like way more sustained across. So the the energy is more spread out across the whole like partials. Whereas here, like with the piano, like it, it seems to be like a little bit less. So, right? And so by looking at this, you can say, OK, so one of the reasons why like this two sounds are different is because of the a distribution of the energy across the different partials being different. Ok, cool. Ok. Now, don't worry, like if you don't have an idea about like what spectrograms are or how we, we got to uh to them or anything like that because this is gonna be a key topic and we're gonna cover this like in a lot of detail because like it's all about spectrograms and believe me, spectrograms are the key to a online sound. Ok. Well, I didn't want to go here. I just like spoiled what's coming next, but let's move on. OK. So now we have an idea about harmonic content. Now we have like one final aspect of timbre. So we said um envelope harmonic content and now frequency and amplitude modulation. So basically modulation in the uh the sound like itself. So what's frequency modulation? So frequency mod modulation is also called in music circles as vibrato, right? And basically here you have um periodic variations in frequency and in music, you have this for expressive purposes. But uh like we can create an effect, a vibrato effect by using like frequency modulation. And this can be formalized. And but basically the idea behind this is that you start like with a signal that you want to use to modulate the frequency of a a carrier signal, which is this one like in blue jam in the middle. So you apply like this message signal signal on the carry a signal and you get these results down below and as you can see here, that's a frequency modulation because the frequency starts uh like this. But then the frequency kind of like um uh goes down. OK. And then it goes up and then it goes down, right? And so here we have a frequency modulation. So now you may be wondering, but how does like that sound like now if you are a musician, obviously, you know what a vibrato is. But if you're not, I'm gonna show you and this is where that amazing video comes in. And so here we have a violinist who explains how to uh play vibrato on the violin. So the first thing you'll hear is like the uh kind of like altering like two notes, right? And then after that, you'll hear like how that can become a vibrato. Yeah, that's very dull, right? It's Tuna did did did very, very dull. But if you change the speed there, you'll hear like the typical violin sound, the vibrato sound let's hear. And until you reach normal vibrato speed and you need to, right? That's super cool. Now, every time like you listen to violins or orchestras, like the strings usually used like this vibrato sound quite uh intensively. OK. So uh one thing that I want to say is like uh as a keyboard player, unfortunately, we don't have this luxury of having like a vibrato, but sometimes like, you'll see pianists who like kind of like strike a key and then after that, they kind of try to do every brow, obviously that doesn't have like any effect on the sound. But still if you have that, so it's a, it's like a nice, like quirk. OK. But if you have a midi keyboard, uh midi keyboards have this thing which is like after touch, like and after like you strike a key, then you can like vibrate the sound and it's gonna like vibrate but not on a piano. I can assure you that I've tried. It doesn't work. OK. Uh So now the other type of like modulation that we have is called amplitude modulation. And in musical terms, this is called tremolo and this is still like a periodic variation, but it's not in frequency but in amplitude and once again, music, we can use this like for expressive purposes. OK. So how do we get to amplitude modulation? Basically, it's the same idea. So we have a signal message signal, we have a carrier signal and we apply the signal on the carrier signal but this time not on the frequency but on the amplitude. And so you, you're gonna have like this effect that is like ah so you like bursts and and uh release lack of amplitude like at regular intervals. Now, um I want to show you uh this once again. So, so let me just let go here. So I have a sound down here that I want to show you with with the tremolo right? Amplitude modulation. So let's hear that. But yeah, let's go back to zero. OK. So yeah, you get the idea. So there are like you have like this tremor effects and probably you are familiar with that because like you've heard it like in many different like musical pieces and, and what not, right? But basically the idea here is that when we modulate the sound like this both like on the um amplitude and frequency uh dimensions, what happens is that we, we change the tre of sound. Now we don't really change that much like the perception like of the of the frequency itself, like of the amplitude is more like a quirk that changes the time BRA. It's as if like these things were like localized and had an effect like on time BRA. OK. So here you have it like all the different things like that determine like time brad that we kind of like know of or have like reconstructed. So time Brad for sure is a multifunctional sound uh like dimension dimension of sound and it has like three main things. So we already review them. So amplitude envelope, the harmonic content or distribution of energy uh across different partials and then the uh signal modulation both like in frequency and amplitude. OK. So by now, you should have like a good idea of sound like and all the different uh aspects of sound. So we last time like we saw that sound like is a mechanical wave that propagates through air. It is characterized by frequency like the intensity, we can describe it with frequent intensity chambre and obviously like some of these things are also like quite subjective, like pitch loud dance and of course, uh Tre OK. So now you have like this very nice introduction and we are now ready to go to the next level, which is introducing audio signals. and specifically next time we'll are gonna tackle two very interesting like topics. Well, for for sure, we are gonna introduce like audio signals and then talk about audio to digital conversion called A DC. The acronym and digital to audio conversion or D AC, which is kind of like the inverse process. OK. So I hope you like, you've enjoyed this video.
