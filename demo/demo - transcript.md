    Welcome to our amazing YouTube Browser app, designed to help you find the information you need from YouTube video content! Say goodbye to wasting time watching videos. With just a few clicks, you can get the answers you seek!

    Simply select a YouTube channel and playlist. Then, ask a question related to the content, and AI will retrieve the answer based on the specific topic from the chosen YouTube playlist.

    For instance, let’s say you want to learn how to extract frequency features from an audio signal. 
    The AI will search through the video content of the selected playlist and channel, generating a response in a human-readable format. 
    Using our extensive knowledge database, which contains transcriptions of the audio files from the videos, the AI will provide you with relevant information. 
    You'll even receive a link to the exact YouTube video and timestamp where you can find the answer, allowing you to watch that specific part of the video.
    <break time='8.0s'/>

    Now, let’s look at a different scenario where the question isn't relevant to the playlist. For example, if you ask the AI what is the best way to get to Antarctica, the AI will take a moment to search... 
    <break time='6.0s'/>
    
    you’ll see that it couldn’t find any relevant information in our knowledge base.
    <break time='2.0s'/>
    
    Below, there’s an option for you to leave feedback. This feedback, along with your question and the AI's response, will be saved in our database. This helps the application collect valuable statistics and improve its performance. You can even view all previous questions filtered by relevance, giving you insight into what others are asking.

    Additionally, you have access a statistics dashboard. Here, you'll find several visualization panels that display information like the last five questions asked, feedback statistics, answer relevance, and costs associated with using the OpenAI service.

    The beauty of this application is its scalability. In future, we can easily add more YouTube playlists and channels, which means you'll have access to an even wider range of useful information.

    Thank you for exploring our application, and we can’t wait to help you discover the answers you need!
