    QUESTION: How Mel-Spectrogram can be used in applications?

    CONTEXT: Answer: Hey everybody and welcome to a new exciting video and the audio signal processing for machine learning series. This time we'll be looking into mel spectrograms. This is a flavor of spectrograms that is extensively used in A I audio research and A I audio real world applications. But before we get started into mel spectrograms, I want to give you an overview of what we did over the last couple of videos and that is the short time fourier transform. And we also looked into extracting and visualizing spectrograms. Now, if you're not familiar with this concept, I highly suggest you to go check out my previous two videos, cos what I'm going to say next in the video builds on top of this two notions extensively. Now without further ado let's move on to this visualization of a spectrogram. And as you can see here on the X axis, we have time on the Y axis. As usual we have uh frequency and each point which is represented by a color in this two D representation uh tells us how present a certain frequency is at each point in time.
    Video Title: Mel Spectrograms Explained Easily
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GHCiiDLHQ4&t=0s

Answer: So for example, let's analyze like this second uh mel band over here. So this is like the kind of like the the center point, the center frequency where we have which that's equal to one. And then the farther we move from the center frequency of this mel band and like the the lower the weights, which basically means like that the colors tend to fade out and then uh outside of the extremity we have like pitch black, which basically means that which is always like equal to zero. And then here you can actually see induction like this filter, um triangular filters, right? Uh for all of this uh different male bands. So yeah, um let's move on now to extracting mouse spectrograms now that we know, yeah, how to extract male filter banks and how to, yeah, just visualize them. OK. So extracting mel spectrograms is as easy in Libres as running libros dot T dash mel spectrogram. Now, if you remember uh from my previous video, well, extracting or calculating me spectrograms, uh it's kind of like quite convoluted process because what you should do is actually extracting spectrogram first vanilla spectrograms then
    Video Title: Extracting Mel Spectrograms with Python
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnVE5m3o_0&t=358s

Answer: uh moving on, uh I want to show you the male filter banks before we extract the mel spectrogram from this audio file. So if you remember from my previous video on mel spectrograms, male filter banks are really the key to getting to male spectrograms because what we do is we extract the spectrogram kind of like a vanilla spectrogram and then we apply a male filter bank to it. In other words, we do a matrix multiplication between the male filter banks and the vanilla spectrogram. And what we get is the uh male spectrogram. OK. So now let's take a look at the at how we can extract this uh filter banks. Well, if you remember I gave you like all the the five different steps we we we should put into place to, to create a male filter bank. But the great thing about Libras is that we have a utility function that does all of that for us so that we

Answer: we have like pitch black, which basically means that which is always like equal to zero. And then here you can actually see induction like this filter, um triangular filters, right? Uh for all of this uh different male bands. So yeah, um let's move on now to extracting mouse spectrograms now that we know, yeah, how to extract male filter banks and how to, yeah, just visualize them. OK. So extracting mel spectrograms is as easy in Libres as running libros dot T dash mel spectrogram. Now, if you remember uh from my previous video, well, extracting or calculating me spectrograms, uh it's kind of like quite convoluted process because what you should do is actually extracting spectrogram first vanilla spectrograms then uh uh creating a male filter bank and then apply mail filter banks to the spectrograms. And that's actually what these uh libre dot feature dot males spectrogram function does under the hood. And indeed what you should do here is pass information for both extracting um

Answer: is going to go down. And as you can see here, this is somewhat correlated with the idea of variance, right. So if the energy is spread across the spectrogram across the different sorry across the different frequency bands, then we have like a higher Varian for the energy. And if it's not, if it's just concentrated, we then have like a AAA low uh variant. And now uh the bandwidth can also be called spectral spread. So this is just another way of calling uh bandwidth. And you can now understand why that's the case, right? Because spectral spread is yeah, that idea of like where, how much the energy is spread across the frequency bands. OK. So let's take a look at the applications of the uh bandwidth. Well, uh bandwidth just like the banter and duration spectral centric has been extensively used for music processing, for example, in problems like music, genre, classification of music, mood uh classification. Now all of these features we've talked about today

    QUESTION: How Mel-Spectrogram can be used in applications?

    CONTEXT: Answer: Hey everybody and welcome to a new exciting video and the audio signal processing for machine learning series. This time we'll be looking into mel spectrograms. This is a flavor of spectrograms that is extensively used in A I audio research and A I audio real world applications. But before we get started into mel spectrograms, I want to give you an overview of what we did over the last couple of videos and that is the short time fourier transform. And we also looked into extracting and visualizing spectrograms. Now, if you're not familiar with this concept, I highly suggest you to go check out my previous two videos, cos what I'm going to say next in the video builds on top of this two notions extensively. Now without further ado let's move on to this visualization of a spectrogram. And as you can see here on the X axis, we have time on the Y axis. As usual we have uh frequency and each point which is represented by a color in this two D representation uh tells us how present a certain frequency is at each point in time.
    Video Title: Mel Spectrograms Explained Easily
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GHCiiDLHQ4&t=0s

Answer: So for example, let's analyze like this second uh mel band over here. So this is like the kind of like the the center point, the center frequency where we have which that's equal to one. And then the farther we move from the center frequency of this mel band and like the the lower the weights, which basically means like that the colors tend to fade out and then uh outside of the extremity we have like pitch black, which basically means that which is always like equal to zero. And then here you can actually see induction like this filter, um triangular filters, right? Uh for all of this uh different male bands. So yeah, um let's move on now to extracting mouse spectrograms now that we know, yeah, how to extract male filter banks and how to, yeah, just visualize them. OK. So extracting mel spectrograms is as easy in Libres as running libros dot T dash mel spectrogram. Now, if you remember uh from my previous video, well, extracting or calculating me spectrograms, uh it's kind of like quite convoluted process because what you should do is actually extracting spectrogram first vanilla spectrograms then

    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnVE5m3o_0&t=358s

Answer: uh moving on, uh I want to show you the male filter banks before we extract the mel spectrogram from this audio file. So if you remember from my previous video on mel spectrograms, male filter banks are really the key to getting to male spectrograms because what we do is we extract the spectrogram kind of like a vanilla spectrogram and then we apply a male filter bank to it. In other words, we do a matrix multiplication between the male filter banks and the vanilla spectrogram. And what we get is the uh male spectrogram. OK. So now let's take a look at the at how we can extract this uh filter banks. Well, if you remember I gave you like all the the five different steps we we we should put into place to, to create a male filter bank. But the great thing about Libras is that we have a utility function that does all of that for us so that we

Answer: we have like pitch black, which basically means that which is always like equal to zero. And then here you can actually see induction like this filter, um triangular filters, right? Uh for all of this uh different male bands. So yeah, um let's move on now to extracting mouse spectrograms now that we know, yeah, how to extract male filter banks and how to, yeah, just visualize them. OK. So extracting mel spectrograms is as easy in Libres as running libros dot T dash mel spectrogram. Now, if you remember uh from my previous video, well, extracting or calculating me spectrograms, uh it's kind of like quite convoluted process because what you should do is actually extracting spectrogram first vanilla spectrograms then uh uh creating a male filter bank and then apply mail filter banks to the spectrograms. And that's actually what these uh libre dot feature dot males spectrogram function does under the hood. And indeed what you should do here is pass information for both extracting um
    Video Title: Extracting Mel Spectrograms with Python
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnVE5m3o_0&t=383s

Answer: is going to go down. And as you can see here, this is somewhat correlated with the idea of variance, right. So if the energy is spread across the spectrogram across the different sorry across the different frequency bands, then we have like a higher Varian for the energy. And if it's not, if it's just concentrated, we then have like a AAA low uh variant. And now uh the bandwidth can also be called spectral spread. So this is just another way of calling uh bandwidth. And you can now understand why that's the case, right? Because spectral spread is yeah, that idea of like where, how much the energy is spread across the frequency bands. OK. So let's take a look at the applications of the uh bandwidth. Well, uh bandwidth just like the banter and duration spectral centric has been extensively used for music processing, for example, in problems like music, genre, classification of music, mood uh classification. Now all of these features we've talked about today

    Video Title: Mel Spectrograms Explained Easily
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GHCiiDLHQ4&t=0s

Answer: OK. So now uh let's take a look at the mel spectrogram. So the mel spectrogram is a metric, a metric itself and its shape is given by the number of bands. So we have like the as many number of as many rows as the number of bands that we chose and uh on, on the number of columns that we have is equal to the number of frames of the original spectrograms. OK. So in other words, if you think about this like this uh multiplication here, so applying male filter banks to the spectrogram, what enabled us to do is basically to convert the frequencies just from Hertz to male bands. OK. And that's the whole point of a male spectrogram. And the cool thing now is that we are, we are using uh male bands which are kind of psychologically uh relevant in terms of the way we perceive pitch. OK. But now let's take a look at what this means in terms of like a visual representation. And well, if you're familiar with spectrograms, well, mouse spectrograms are no different at all.
    Video Title: Mel Spectrograms Explained Easily
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GHCiiDLHQ4&t=1539s

Answer: which is the information that we usually get from the time domain. And this is why a spectrogram is called a time frequency representation. And this is why spectrograms are so important in A I audio. Now, I'm not gonna get into the details of the implementation and all of these things like uh for spectrograms because that's the um topic of the next video. So in the next video, we're gonna be using Python and Libros specifically for extracting spectrograms. We're gonna be looking into different flavors of spectrograms and understand which ones to use. And then we're gonna be examining like different audio samples and comparing them perhaps like different musical genres and how like they their spectrograms differ. OK. So I hope like you found uh this video instructive and useful. If that's the case, please consider leaving a like and if you haven't subscribed yet to the channel and you want to see more videos like this, please consider subscribing.

Answer: the uh like vanilla spectrogram as well as the co creating like a male uh filter back. So we pass in the the signal. So in this case, it's our scale signal. Then we should specify the some the frame size, the H length. And these are uh this is all the information that we need for extracting the spectrogram. And then we also need to pass the number of male bands which yeah, let's put it just like equal to 90 for example, right? And as I said, what ma spectrogram does under the hood is calculating the uh vanilla spectrogram. It creates the male filter banks and apply the male filter banks uh to the spectrogram. OK. So let's run this. And next, what I want to show you guys is the shape of this um males spectrogram, right?

Answer: um I just want to remind you about how we can extract frequent frequency domain uh features in a nutshell in a very simplistic way. What we do is we start from the waveform, then we apply a short time fourier transform and so that we get a spectrogram. And then at this point, we can compute a feature computation so that we can arrive at a feature. Now, as I said, this is a simplification of the whole process and I have a whole video that details how to extract audio features in general and the frequency domain audio features specifically. So I highly suggest you to go check out that video. Then another thing that is gonna be a required for this video if you want to really understand it is the understanding of short time fourier transform and the understanding of what a spectrogram is. Now, once again, I have a bunch of videos on that. So just go check them out in this series. I just want to share a couple of math conventions that we'll be using during the video. So the first one is this MTON

    QUESTION: How to extract frequency from audio file?

    CONTEXT: Answer: Hi, everybody and welcome to a new exciting video in the audio signal processing for machine learning series. Last time we looked at mad frequency CEPT coefficients from a theoretical standpoint. In this video, I want to show you how you can extract MF CCS using Python and Libros. So let's get started with this Jupiter notebook. So the first thing I want to do is just import a bunch of libraries that we'll be using. So I'll import Li Brosa Libros dot display, ipython dot display, uh Pylot and then pie. So let's do that. Next thing we want to load uh an audio file. So which file are we gonna load? So it's a file that we, you should be familiar with by. Now it's a, a short passage of a piece from clothes, the Bey. So we're talking about classical music here.
    Video Title: Extracting Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients with Python
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJI-17MNpdE&t=0s

Answer: OK. So next up what we wanna do is just like a uh yeah load uh this audio file in Li Brosa. And so for that, and you should be familiar with this right now. We do a Li Brosa dot load and we pass in the path to the file. What we get back is a signal uh which is just like an empire array and then ad sample rate and the default sample rate with libros is 22,050 Hertz. OK. So uh moving on, uh I want to show you the male filter banks before we extract the mel spectrogram from this audio file. So if you remember from my previous video on mel spectrograms, male filter banks are really the key to getting to male spectrograms because what we do is we extract the spectrogram kind of like a vanilla spectrogram and then we apply a male filter bank to it. In other words, we do a matrix multiplication between the male filter banks and the vanilla spectrogram. And what we get is the

Answer: OK. Simple C major scale uh with a piano. OK. So next up what we wanna do is just like a uh yeah load uh this audio file in Li Brosa. And so for that, and you should be familiar with this right now. We do a Li Brosa dot load and we pass in the path to the file. What we get back is a signal uh which is just like an empire array and then ad sample rate and the default sample rate with libros is 22,050 Hertz. OK.

In other words, we do a matrix multiplication between the male filter banks and the vanilla spectrogram. And what we get is the uh male spectrogram. OK. So now let's take a look at the at how we can extract this uh filter banks. Well, if you remember I gave you like all the the five different steps we we we should put into place to, to create a male filter bank. But the great thing about Libras is that we have a utility function that does all of that for us so that we
    Video Title: Extracting Mel Spectrograms with Python
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnVE5m3o_0&t=96s

Answer: uh we have a deep knowledge of fourier transform, short term fourier transform. And so we know how to move to the frequency domain today, we'll be looking into three frequency domain audio features specifically, these are the band energy ratio, the spectral centr and the bandwidth. I just want to say that there are a lot more frequency domain features. But for today, we'll just be focusing on these ones. OK. So um I just want to remind you about how we can extract frequent frequency domain uh features in a nutshell in a very simplistic way. What we do is we start from the waveform, then we apply a short time fourier transform and so that we get a spectrogram.

    QUESTION: What do the authors of the video think about aliens?

    CONTEXT: Answer: kind of like mental exercise that we'll use in the next video where we are actually gonna put into place all of the knowledge that we've acquired today about complex numbers in order to create a complex representation of the fourier transform. And you'll be delighted by that because it's gonna look like so wonderful and so simple, good. So this was like a quite intense video film, but I hope that you've enjoyed it because now you should have a good understanding, an operational understanding of complex numbers, uh their uh representation in Cartesian coordinates in polar coordinates, the Euler formula, the exponential and all of this like nice things here. So yeah, that's it for today. I hope you've enjoyed the video. If that's the case, please remember to leave a like and if you haven't subscribed P, please consider doing so. And as usual, if you have any questions. Please leave them in the comments section below. I'll try to answer to those and I guess that's it. I'll see you next time. Cheers.

Answer: uh the success of this series is gonna be measured against this thing. So the moment you'll see a spectrogram like this, you just don't freak out but rather know what we're talking about and what this image is actually telling you all your wise and you're gonna be able to interpret it good. Who's this series for? Well, if you are a machine learning or more specifically deep learning engineer and you're tapping your feet into the audio domain, this is a perfect series for you. Same thing. If you are a computer science student, I've received a ton of requests from CS students who have asked me, how can I uh preprocess audio data for this specific audio A I application? Well, you're going to get most of those answers here in this um series. Now, if you are a software engineer with an interest in audio and music, again, this is uh a series that's for you.

Answer: the features automatically by themselves. Without us, the human engineers doing like human hand ping of features and things like that. OK. That's it. So now you should have more or less like an idea of the different types of audio features we'll be dealing with. So uh if there's one thing that I hope you'll take away from this uh video is that's like the main categorization that we can use instead of like the signal domain. So we, and that's like what we'll be doing in future videos, we'll be reviewing uh time domain audio features, frequency domain audio features and time frequency uh features as well. OK. So what's up next then?
    Video Title: Types of Audio Features for Machine Learning
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ9u1vUtcIA&t=1248s

Answer: good. So I think like you should really, really congratulate like yourself because uh we've done a lot of work like in this video. So we looked at the subs, we looked like at the math behind subst, we looked at the visualization of the subs how we can interpret subst in the context of speech. And then we moved on to male frequency subs coefficients. But up until up until now, we've just uh dealt with theory. So as it is usually the case in this series, uh the next step is gonna be that of implementation or just like playing around with Python. So in the next video, we'll use all of the information that we've used here in this video to extract MF CCS with Python and Lisa. And we'll also visualize MF CCS for different audio files. OK. So I really hope that you enjoyed this video

Who's this series for? Well, if you are a machine learning or more specifically deep learning engineer and you're tapping your feet into the audio domain, this is a perfect series for you. Same thing. If you are a computer science student,
    Video Title: Audio Signal Processing for Machine Learning
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCwMQJnKk2c&t=436s

Answer: the features automatically by themselves. Without us, the human engineers doing like human hand ping of features and things like that. OK. That's it. So now you should have more or less like an idea of the different types of audio features we'll be dealing with. So uh if there's one thing that I hope you'll take away from this uh video is that's like the main categorization that we can use instead of like the signal domain. So we, and that's like what we'll be doing in future videos, we'll be reviewing uh time domain audio features, frequency domain audio features and time frequency uh features as well. OK. So what's up next then?

So what's up next then? So now you have a good picture like of the different ingredients that we are going to play around with. So namely the audio features, the next step is to understand how we extract them directly from audio. So in the next video, we're gonna look at the feature

    QUESTION: What do the authors of the videos think about New Zealand?

    CONTEXT: Answer: kind of like mental exercise that we'll use in the next video where we are actually gonna put into place all of the knowledge that we've acquired today about complex numbers in order to create a complex representation of the fourier transform. And you'll be delighted by that because it's gonna look like so wonderful and so simple, good. So this was like a quite intense video film, but I hope that you've enjoyed it because now you should have a good understanding, an operational understanding of complex numbers, uh their uh representation in Cartesian coordinates in polar coordinates, the Euler formula, the exponential and all of this like nice things here. So yeah, that's it for today. I hope you've enjoyed the video. If that's the case, please remember to leave a like and if you haven't subscribed P, please consider doing so. And as usual, if you have any questions. Please leave them in the comments section below. I'll try to answer to those and I guess that's it. I'll see you next time. Cheers.

Answer: required for this video if you want to really understand it is the understanding of short time fourier transform and the understanding of what a spectrogram is. Now, once again, I have a bunch of videos on that. So just go check them out in this series. I just want to share a couple of math conventions that we'll be using during the video. So the first one is this MTON and this will stand for the magnitude of the signal at a given frequency bin and, and at a given frame T and then the other convention that we'll be using is that capital N is equal to the number of frequency bins that we have in the uh spectrogram. Let's jump to the first audio feature that's band energy ratio. And this feature provides us information about the relation between the energy in the lower and the higher frequency bands. So uh we can think of this as a measure of how dominant the lower frequency

Answer: if you usually follow the sound of the I channel, you know that I love to cover both theoretical stuff and uh implementation stuff. So this series is gonna be no different. So we're gonna have theoretical sessions where I dig deeper into the theoretical ideas behind the the stuff that we are uh discussing and then we're gonna have coding uh sessions where I implement all the theoretical stuff that we've discussed. Now, you may be wondering, but where do I get all the material that you'll be posting with these videos? Well, I have a github uh page that's linked in the uh descript description section below and there you can find the code samples as well as the slides just to, to have all the material with yourself for review. So uh if you're familiar with my channel, you know that I literally love Python and it's not, this shouldn't come as a surprise to you that throughout the series, I'm gonna be using Python. And then on top of that, I'm gonna be using li browser, which is an open source audio processing libraries that we can use to extract loads of all your features in a very handy way.

And then on top of that, I'm gonna be using li browser, which is an open source audio processing libraries that we can use to extract loads of all your features in a very handy way. OK. So what will you learn from an operational standpoint? First of all, you're gonna get a deep dive into all your data so that you really know what you are talking about there and how to manipulate and preprocess all of this data. Then obviously you'll familiarize with um frequency and time domain or

    QUESTION: What is the best way to get to Antarctica?

    CONTEXT: Answer: That's great, but we haven't learned yet about the polar coordinates. So now how do we move to polar coordinates? Well, once again, we have to go back to some uh trigonometry. And here, so you see that the side A is equal to the hypotenuse the absolute value of C multiplied by the cosine of gamma. And it's this guy here and then B, the side B is equal to the hypotenuse multiplied by the line of gamma. Right. Now here we have the Cartesian representation of a complex number. So what we can do next is get A and substitute A with this formula over here because it's the same thing as we've seen
    Video Title: Complex Numbers for Audio Signal Processing
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgF4m0AWCgA&t=733s

Answer: in other words, uh like what we do is basically conceptually is we take the center of gravity and then we multiply that by the number of steps that we have that we are considering. And so the higher the number of steps that we are considering and then the, the higher the the the number of times we are multiplying the center of gravity for cool but good. But what happens if we, we have like that 1.1 frequency instead which like the whole like symmetrical, really cool shape. So now let's go back to say between zero and 10 and here we'll do uh 1000 steps. So what's your guess? What are we going to see? Where is the green, where does like the green dot land?

    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxRmbtJWUzI&t=1807s

Answer: kind of like idea of how we get to that single point uh taking the foreign transform and basically going through the hassle of calculating all of this best, right. So what we do is we wrap around as the first step everything uh the the signal around the complex plane. And then we can we take the average of the center of gravity of this and that is going to be a complex number and that is the uh coefficient the full transform transform coefficients that has information about the face as well as about the magnitude. And the magnitude is given by the distance of this dot from the center of gravity dot from the origin and the face is given by the angle from the positive real axis.

Answer: out. So Euler, you are a great man and you were right, by the way, this chap is Leonard Euler, one of the most brilliant mathematicians to ever live on planet Earth. OK. But now let's go back to our polar coordinates for the uh complex numbers. OK. So uh the top equation here gives us the port code units as we've come to know them. And here we have the Euler formula. Do you notice something interesting there that we could use to our advantage? Well, yes. So this guy here is basically our exponential here. So what we can do is take this exponential and plug it in here, right? And so we can rewrite our polar coordinates like this. So a complex number C is equal to the absolute value of C times E
    Video Title: Complex Numbers for Audio Signal Processing
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgF4m0AWCgA&t=1139s

Answer: good. So this way we can get gamma or yeah, the the gamma angle directly from the Cartesian coordinates. So now I'll store this couple of parameters here. And this is like the way we can get both the angle gamma and the absolute value C starting from the Cartesian coordinates and information about A AND B. That's great, but we haven't learned yet about the polar coordinates. So now how do we move to polar coordinates? Well, once again, we have to go back to some uh trigonometry. And here, so you see that the side A is equal to the hypotenuse the absolute value of C multiplied by the cosine of gamma. And it's this guy here and then B, the side B is equal to the hypotenuse multiplied by the

    QUESTION: What is the best way to get to Antarctica?

    CONTEXT: Answer: spec dot capital T. And so this way we just get the transfer of the power uh spectrum. OK? So now let's create a variable like this. So an empty list like this and this is where we'll cash the band energy ratio for each frame. And remember the band energy ratio as as a feature is is a frame best frame based feature. So we're going to have a value

Answer: earlier. In other words, the lifting or a lifter, what we want to use here is a low pass lifter, which is basically a nice way of saying that we want a low pass filter that's just gonna remove all the values are related to the high uh equivalences. OK. And so once we do that, we remain only if the SES coefficients connected to the spectral envelope, which is the stuff that we wanted. Now that we know about the subs we can move on and understand what male frequency subs coefficients are. The cool thing is that MFCC is built on top of sere. So that is gonna be a piece of cake for us. The best way we can understand how MFC work is by looking at how we can compute them. And this is a multi step process. Many of the steps are shared by how we compute SERE and MFCC. So let's get started. We begin with a simple waveform. So signal in the time domain, as usual we apply the full transform and we get a spectrum out of that. Next step is to apply a logarithm to the amplitude so that we get a log spectrum.

And up until this point, the process for getting subs stream and male frequency subst coefficients is actually the same right. But here we have the first divergence. So what we do next is applying mel scaling. What this means is that we take the log spectrum and we apply the mall filter banks which are these triangular filters like this, right? So if you followed along

Answer: dot capital T. And so this way we just get the transfer of the power uh spectrum. OK? So now let's create a variable like this. So an empty list like this and this is where we'll cash the band energy ratio for each frame. And remember the band energy ratio as as a feature is is a frame best frame based feature. So we're going to have a value a band energy ratio for each frame. So and we'll be cashing it for each frame here like in this variable called band energy ratio here. OK. So we'll do now I will iterate through all the frames in the power spectrogram.

Answer: the thing here is that, so now let's go back to one here. Uh The cool thing here is that we can think of the complex fourier transform coefficient as this point in the complex plane, right? And so now you get a kind of like idea of how we get to that single point uh taking the foreign transform and basically going through the hassle of calculating all of this best, right.

    QUESTION: How to extract frequency from audio file?

    CONTEXT: Answer: Hi, everybody and welcome to a new exciting video in the audio signal processing for machine learning series. Last time we looked at mad frequency CEPT coefficients from a theoretical standpoint. In this video, I want to show you how you can extract MF CCS using Python and Libros. So let's get started with this Jupiter notebook. So the first thing I want to do is just import a bunch of libraries that we'll be using. So I'll import Li Brosa Libros dot display, ipython dot display, uh Pylot and then pie. So let's do that. Next thing we want to load uh an audio file. So which file are we gonna load? So it's a file that we, you should be familiar with by. Now it's a, a short passage of a piece from clothes, the Bey. So we're talking about classical music here.
    Video Title: Extracting Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients with Python
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJI-17MNpdE&t=0s

Answer: OK. So next up what we wanna do is just like a uh yeah load uh this audio file in Li Brosa. And so for that, and you should be familiar with this right now. We do a Li Brosa dot load and we pass in the path to the file. What we get back is a signal uh which is just like an empire array and then ad sample rate and the default sample rate with libros is 22,050 Hertz. OK. So uh moving on, uh I want to show you the male filter banks before we extract the mel spectrogram from this audio file. So if you remember from my previous video on mel spectrograms, male filter banks are really the key to getting to male spectrograms because what we do is we extract the spectrogram kind of like a vanilla spectrogram and then we apply a male filter bank to it. In other words, we do a matrix multiplication between the male filter banks and the vanilla spectrogram. And what we get is the

    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnVE5m3o_0&t=68s

Answer: OK. Simple C major scale uh with a piano. OK. So next up what we wanna do is just like a uh yeah load uh this audio file in Li Brosa. And so for that, and you should be familiar with this right now. We do a Li Brosa dot load and we pass in the path to the file. What we get back is a signal uh which is just like an empire array and then ad sample rate and the default sample rate with libros is 22,050 Hertz. OK. So uh moving on, uh I want to show you the male filter banks before we extract the mel spectrogram from this audio file.

In other words, we do a matrix multiplication between the male filter banks and the vanilla spectrogram. And what we get is the uh male spectrogram. OK. So now let's take a look at the at how we can extract this uh filter banks. Well, if you remember I gave you like all the the five different steps we we we should put into place to, to create a male filter bank. But the great thing about Libras is that we have a utility function that does all of that for us so that we
    Video Title: Extracting Mel Spectrograms with Python
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnVE5m3o_0&t=96s

Answer: uh we have a deep knowledge of fourier transform, short term fourier transform. And so we know how to move to the frequency domain today, we'll be looking into three frequency domain audio features specifically, these are the band energy ratio, the spectral centr and the bandwidth. I just want to say that there are a lot more frequency domain features. But for today, we'll just be focusing on these ones. OK. So um I just want to remind you about how we can extract frequent frequency domain uh features in a nutshell in a very simplistic way. What we do is we start from the waveform, then we apply a short time fourier transform and so that we get a spectrogram. And then at this point, we can compute a feature computation so that we can arrive at a feature. Now, as I said, this is a simplification of the whole process and I have a whole video that details how to extract audio features in general and the frequency domain audio features specifically. So I highly suggest you to go check out that video. Then another thing that is gonna be a

    QUESTION: How Mel-Spectrogram can be used in applications?

    CONTEXT: Answer: Hey everybody and welcome to a new exciting video and the audio signal processing for machine learning series. This time we'll be looking into mel spectrograms. This is a flavor of spectrograms that is extensively used in A I audio research and A I audio real world applications. But before we get started into mel spectrograms, I want to give you an overview of what we did over the last couple of videos and that is the short time fourier transform. And we also looked into extracting and visualizing spectrograms. Now, if you're not familiar with this concept, I highly suggest you to go check out my previous two videos, cos what I'm going to say next in the video builds on top of this two notions extensively. Now without further ado let's move on to this visualization of a spectrogram. And as you can see here on the X axis, we have time on the Y axis. As usual we have uh frequency and each point which is represented by a color in this two D representation uh tells us how present a certain frequency is at each point in time.
    Video Title: Mel Spectrograms Explained Easily
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GHCiiDLHQ4&t=0s

Answer: So for example, let's analyze like this second uh mel band over here. So this is like the kind of like the the center point, the center frequency where we have which that's equal to one. And then the farther we move from the center frequency of this mel band and like the the lower the weights, which basically means like that the colors tend to fade out and then uh outside of the extremity we have like pitch black, which basically means that which is always like equal to zero. And then here you can actually see induction like this filter, um triangular filters, right? Uh for all of this uh different male bands. So yeah, um let's move on now to extracting mouse spectrograms now that we know, yeah, how to extract male filter banks and how to, yeah, just visualize them. OK. So extracting mel spectrograms is as easy in Libres as running libros dot T dash mel spectrogram. Now, if you remember uh from my previous video, well, extracting or calculating me spectrograms, uh it's kind of like quite convoluted process because what you should do is actually extracting spectrogram first vanilla spectrograms then
    Video Title: Extracting Mel Spectrograms with Python
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnVE5m3o_0&t=358s

Answer: uh moving on, uh I want to show you the male filter banks before we extract the mel spectrogram from this audio file. So if you remember from my previous video on mel spectrograms, male filter banks are really the key to getting to male spectrograms because what we do is we extract the spectrogram kind of like a vanilla spectrogram and then we apply a male filter bank to it. In other words, we do a matrix multiplication between the male filter banks and the vanilla spectrogram. And what we get is the uh male spectrogram. OK. So now let's take a look at the at how we can extract this uh filter banks. Well, if you remember I gave you like all the the five different steps we we we should put into place to, to create a male filter bank. But the great thing about Libras is that we have a utility function that does all of that for us so that we

Answer: we have like pitch black, which basically means that which is always like equal to zero. And then here you can actually see induction like this filter, um triangular filters, right? Uh for all of this uh different male bands. So yeah, um let's move on now to extracting mouse spectrograms now that we know, yeah, how to extract male filter banks and how to, yeah, just visualize them. OK. So extracting mel spectrograms is as easy in Libres as running libros dot T dash mel spectrogram. Now, if you remember uh from my previous video, well, extracting or calculating me spectrograms, uh it's kind of like quite convoluted process because what you should do is actually extracting spectrogram first vanilla spectrograms then uh uh creating a male filter bank and then apply mail filter banks to the spectrograms. And that's actually what these uh libre dot feature dot males spectrogram function does under the hood. And indeed what you should do here is pass information for both extracting um
    Video Title: Extracting Mel Spectrograms with Python
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnVE5m3o_0&t=383s

Answer: is going to go down. And as you can see here, this is somewhat correlated with the idea of variance, right. So if the energy is spread across the spectrogram across the different sorry across the different frequency bands, then we have like a higher Varian for the energy. And if it's not, if it's just concentrated, we then have like a AAA low uh variant. And now uh the bandwidth can also be called spectral spread. So this is just another way of calling uh bandwidth. And you can now understand why that's the case, right? Because spectral spread is yeah, that idea of like where, how much the energy is spread across the frequency bands. OK. So let's take a look at the applications of the uh bandwidth. Well, uh bandwidth just like the banter and duration spectral centric has been extensively used for music processing, for example, in problems like music, genre, classification of music, mood uh classification. Now all of these features we've talked about today

Answer: Hey everybody and welcome to a new exciting video and the audio signal processing for machine learning series. This time we'll be looking into mel spectrograms. This is a flavor of spectrograms that is extensively used in A I audio research and A I audio real world applications. But before we get started into mel spectrograms, I want to give you an overview of what we did over the last couple of videos and that is the short time fourier transform.

    Video Title: Mel Spectrograms Explained Easily
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GHCiiDLHQ4&t=0s

Answer: OK. So now uh let's take a look at the mel spectrogram. So the mel spectrogram is a metric, a metric itself and its shape is given by the number of bands. So we have like the as many number of as many rows as the number of bands that we chose and uh on, on the number of columns that we have is equal to the number of frames of the original spectrograms. OK. So in other words, if you think about this like this uh multiplication here, so applying male filter banks to the spectrogram, what enabled us to do is basically to convert the frequencies just from Hertz to male bands. OK. And that's the whole point of a male spectrogram. And the cool thing now is that we are, we are using uh male bands which are kind of psychologically uh relevant in terms of the way we perceive pitch. OK. But now let's take a look at what this means in terms of like a visual representation. And well, if you're familiar with spectrograms, well, mouse spectrograms are no different at all.
    Video Title: Mel Spectrograms Explained Easily
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GHCiiDLHQ4&t=1539s

Answer: which is the information that we usually get from the time domain. And this is why a spectrogram is called a time frequency representation. And this is why spectrograms are so important in A I audio. Now, I'm not gonna get into the details of the implementation and all of these things like uh for spectrograms because that's the um topic of the next video. So in the next video, we're gonna be using Python and Libros specifically for extracting spectrograms. We're gonna be looking into different flavors of spectrograms and understand which ones to use. And then we're gonna be examining like different audio samples and comparing them perhaps like different musical genres and how like they their spectrograms differ. OK. So I hope like you found uh this video instructive and useful. If that's the case, please consider leaving a like and if you haven't subscribed yet to the channel and you want to see more videos like this, please consider subscribing. So if you have any questions, please leave them in the comments section below. I think that's all for today. I'll see you next time. Cheers.

Answer: the uh like vanilla spectrogram as well as the co creating like a male uh filter back. So we pass in the the signal. So in this case, it's our scale signal. Then we should specify the some the frame size, the H length. And these are uh this is all the information that we need for extracting the spectrogram. And then we also need to pass the number of male bands which yeah, let's put it just like equal to 90 for example, right? And as I said, what ma spectrogram does under the hood is calculating the uh vanilla spectrogram. It creates the male filter banks and apply the male filter banks uh to the spectrogram. OK. So let's run this. And next, what I want to show you guys is the shape of this um males spectrogram, right?

    QUESTION: How Mel-Spectrogram can be used in applications?

    CONTEXT: Answer: Hey everybody and welcome to a new exciting video and the audio signal processing for machine learning series. This time we'll be looking into mel spectrograms. This is a flavor of spectrograms that is extensively used in A I audio research and A I audio real world applications. But before we get started into mel spectrograms, I want to give you an overview of what we did over the last couple of videos and that is the short time fourier transform. And we also looked into extracting and visualizing spectrograms. Now, if you're not familiar with this concept, I highly suggest you to go check out my previous two videos, cos what I'm going to say next in the video builds on top of this two notions extensively. Now without further ado let's move on to this visualization of a spectrogram. And as you can see here on the X axis, we have time on the Y axis. As usual we have uh frequency and each point which is represented by a color in this two D representation uh tells us how present a certain frequency is at each point in time.
    Video Title: Mel Spectrograms Explained Easily
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GHCiiDLHQ4&t=0s

Answer: So for example, let's analyze like this second uh mel band over here. So this is like the kind of like the the center point, the center frequency where we have which that's equal to one. And then the farther we move from the center frequency of this mel band and like the the lower the weights, which basically means like that the colors tend to fade out and then uh outside of the extremity we have like pitch black, which basically means that which is always like equal to zero. And then here you can actually see induction like this filter, um triangular filters, right? Uh for all of this uh different male bands. So yeah, um let's move on now to extracting mouse spectrograms now that we know, yeah, how to extract male filter banks and how to, yeah, just visualize them. OK. So extracting mel spectrograms is as easy in Libres as running libros dot T dash mel spectrogram. Now, if you remember uh from my previous video, well, extracting or calculating me spectrograms, uh it's kind of like quite convoluted process because what you should do is actually extracting spectrogram first vanilla spectrograms then
    Video Title: Extracting Mel Spectrograms with Python
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnVE5m3o_0&t=358s

Answer: uh moving on, uh I want to show you the male filter banks before we extract the mel spectrogram from this audio file. So if you remember from my previous video on mel spectrograms, male filter banks are really the key to getting to male spectrograms because what we do is we extract the spectrogram kind of like a vanilla spectrogram and then we apply a male filter bank to it. In other words, we do a matrix multiplication between the male filter banks and the vanilla spectrogram. And what we get is the uh male spectrogram. OK. So now let's take a look at the at how we can extract this uh filter banks. Well, if you remember I gave you like all the the five different steps we we we should put into place to, to create a male filter bank. But the great thing about Libras is that we have a utility function that does all of that for us so that we

Answer: we have like pitch black, which basically means that which is always like equal to zero. And then here you can actually see induction like this filter, um triangular filters, right? Uh for all of this uh different male bands. So yeah, um let's move on now to extracting mouse spectrograms now that we know, yeah, how to extract male filter banks and how to, yeah, just visualize them. OK. So extracting mel spectrograms is as easy in Libres as running libros dot T dash mel spectrogram. Now, if you remember uh from my previous video, well, extracting or calculating me spectrograms, uh it's kind of like quite convoluted process because what you should do is actually extracting spectrogram first vanilla spectrograms then uh uh creating a male filter bank and then apply mail filter banks to the spectrograms. And that's actually what these uh libre dot feature dot males spectrogram function does under the hood. And indeed what you should do here is pass information for both extracting um
    Video Title: Extracting Mel Spectrograms with Python
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnVE5m3o_0&t=383s

Answer: is going to go down. And as you can see here, this is somewhat correlated with the idea of variance, right. So if the energy is spread across the spectrogram across the different sorry across the different frequency bands, then we have like a higher Varian for the energy. And if it's not, if it's just concentrated, we then have like a AAA low uh variant. And now uh the bandwidth can also be called spectral spread. So this is just another way of calling uh bandwidth. And you can now understand why that's the case, right? Because spectral spread is yeah, that idea of like where, how much the energy is spread across the frequency bands. OK. So let's take a look at the applications of the uh bandwidth. Well, uh bandwidth just like the banter and duration spectral centric has been extensively used for music processing, for example, in problems like music, genre, classification of music, mood uh classification. Now all of these features we've talked about today

    QUESTION: What is a frequency?

    CONTEXT: Answer: OK? But I know this can feel a little bit abstract. So let's go move on with an example. So here we have like a bunch of like uh STFT uh parameters and we want to find the actual output shape. So we have a signal with 10,000 samples, we have a frame size which is equal to 1000 samples and we have a H size of 500 samples. So uh for the number of frequency bins, so we take the frame size, we divided it by two, we add one and we get 501 frequency bins. OK? But these are frequency bins and we know that uh they divide a certain frequency range um equally. And so we have like a frequency range that's divided in 501 bins in this case. Uh Now what, what, what is that range? Well, that range and the frequency range is between zero Hertz and the sampling range divided by two Hertz. And that is the NS frequency once again.
    Video Title: Short-Time Fourier Transform Explained Easily
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Yxj3yfvY-4&t=1305s

Answer: obviously there's a certain level uh of like, I mean, it's arbitrary to a certain extent, but then there's like some reasoning behind it. And to understand what the reasoning is, we need to introduce another concept, which is the nest frequency that comes from the NWS theorem. We can um indicate this which are F or then and the NIST frequency is given by half the sampling rates. What the liquid frequency tells us is basically the upper bound frequency that we can have in a digital signal that's not going to recreate any artifacts, right? So basically up until the nus frequency, we can reconstruct a signal. OK. But if we go above the nus frequency in our signal, we are gonna start to have artifacts and we'll see what those artifacts are in a second.

    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daB9naGBVv4&t=515s

Answer: uh is equal to the uh split frequency. And this is given in Hertz and that's divided by the frequency delta per bin. In other words, what we are doing is we are mapping this continuous um frequency, that's the split frequency onto the, the closest frequency uh bin available. And uh but uh you, you may see here that uh given like we have two numbers. So the frequency to frequency delta per bin, it's likely that we're gonna get like some kind of a float number. And obviously the the frequency bins that we have are the script and that, that's the whole point of having like this critic here. So we can't take a frequency bin that's equal to 10.4. It doesn't make sense, right? So we have to move to uh an integer number. So we have to round up the numbers. So what, what can we do to round this round this number? So we can use the NP dot uh floor function

    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UJ8ZDR7yUs&t=434s

Answer: the spectrogram has discrete values, right? So it has discrete frequency bins. So we need to create a function that maps a continuous frequency onto the discrete frequency bins that we have. And so that's what we want to build now. So we'll uh define a function and we'll cal we'll call it, calculate uh split frequency bin like this and this uh function accepts a few parameters. So first of all, it, it accepts a spectrogram, then the split frequency and finally the sample rate. OK. So now let's uh see what we should do here like all the different steps. So as the first thing, what we want to calculate is the frequency range that we have in the spectrogram. In other words, so we want to ask ourselves. So how uh what's the frequency range that we are capturing in the spectrogram? And now to show you what I mean here, let me just go back and take a look at the, for example, at the, the BC spectrogram. So
    Video Title: Implementing Band Energy Ratio in Python from Scratch

Answer: What the liquid frequency tells us is basically the upper bound frequency that we can have in a digital signal that's not going to recreate any artifacts, right? So basically up until the nus frequency, we can reconstruct a signal. OK. But if we go above the nus frequency in our signal, we are gonna start to have artifacts and we'll see what those artifacts are in a second. Now, if we move back to the uh to the CD example, and we take a look at the nucleus frequency for the CD, that's 44.1 K divided by two, which gives us 22,050 Hertz. This is the nucleus frequency for a CD. Now this number should ring a bell for you.

    QUESTION: What is a frequency?

    CONTEXT: Answer: after this little teacher with the sound of A I is like community. Let's go back to like the plot here. And as we said, so when we have the frequency ratio which is equal to one still we get all of our um f the frequency like has all the original frequency bins. And so it's up to the uh sample rate frequency which is 22,050 Hertz. But if we change date, say to 0.5 we'll just have uh we'll just consider the frequencies up up to the Nicholas frequency which is half the sample rate, which in this case is 11,000 Hertz. And uh but still here we see that most of the energy is contained in like lower frequencies. So I to zoom in, I'll just like put a 0.1 here. And as you can see here, like this is like nice because here we can actually see the different frequencies that are like involved in shaping

Answer: obviously there's a certain level uh of like, I mean, it's arbitrary to a certain extent, but then there's like some reasoning behind it. And to understand what the reasoning is, we need to introduce another concept, which is the nest frequency that comes from the NWS theorem. We can um indicate this which are F or then and the NIST frequency is given by half the sampling rates. What the liquid frequency tells us is basically the upper bound frequency that we can have in a digital signal that's not going to recreate any artifacts, right? So basically up until the nus frequency, we can reconstruct a signal. OK. But if we go above the nus frequency in our signal, we are gonna start to have artifacts and we'll see what those artifacts are in a second.

    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daB9naGBVv4&t=515s

Answer: F because this is the one if you recall, that's gonna tell us uh that's gonna give us like the threshold that we'll use to say. OK. So all the frequencies above this frequency are uh belong to the higher frequencies and all the frequencies below the split frequency below to the lower frequencies. But now, obviously, uh we can pass in a continuous frequency like in Hertz like 2000 Hertz or 3000 Hertz. But the spectrogram has discrete values, right? So it has discrete frequency bins. So we need to create a function that maps a continuous frequency onto the discrete frequency bins that we have. And so that's what we want to build now. So we'll uh define a function and we'll cal we'll call it, calculate uh split frequency bin like this and this uh function accepts a few parameters. So first of all, it, it accepts a spectrogram, then the split frequency and finally the sample rate. OK.

    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UJ8ZDR7yUs&t=205s

Answer: what do does 1025 frequency bins like uh correspond to in terms of like frequency range? OK. So, and how do we do that? Well, this is like uh something that we can easily do because uh we know that the spectrogram um reduces the its like frequency range from the sample range, it moves on to the NICS frequency. And so we can obtain that by uh doing the sample rate divided by two, the next logical step here is to calculate the delta uh frequency between two adjacent uh bins. So in other words, how much, so when we move, say from frequency bin to number three to frequency bin four, so how much do we actually move in the continuous frequency? Right. And so we can do that by saying that the frequency

    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UJ8ZDR7yUs&t=329s

Answer: Basically the idea here is that in a spectrum, you have information both about time and frequency on the X axis indeed you have time whereas on the y axis you have frequencies and basically here what you see is the different frequency components at different points in time. And the amount of contribution that each frequency band has at this particular time is described through a color. In this case, the brighter the color the more the um contribution that's particular frequency band at that specific time. So, and as you can see here, we have like a lot of contribution from this uh frequency of 256 Hertz, which is A I I believe like middle C, OK. And this like uh computes correctly because if we go back to the spectrum, which is kind of like snapshot for the whole sound, we have a peak here which is most likely around 256 as well. OK.

    QUESTION: What is a frequency?

    CONTEXT: Answer: right. And so here the, the uh frequency interval that we want to consider is between zero Hertz and the sample rate itself. And uh the number of like evenly paced uh values that we want and it's equal to the length of magnitude. And so basically, we have like these two arrays and magnitude has like the values. So the the actual like magnitudes of each frequency bin. And so it's basically so like these two like rays together are telling us how much each frequency is contributing to the overall uh sound. OK. So now let's plot this and uh for plotting this, which by the way is the power spectrum, uh we don't have like a fancy uh Li Brosa like shortcut function rather, we should use vanilla uh mat plot lib. So we'll do plots dot uh plot and we'll pass in the frequency as well as the uh magnet. And then, yeah, I guess we want to pass the, the labels as well. So on the X label given, we are in the frequency domain, we are expecting

    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa_d-zaUti8&t=453s

Answer: And that's because like once we, we cross half the frequency here, we're just like repeating uh like the, the same like information. So we just want to focus on the first half. So let's, let's do that here. So uh we can just like go back here and say that we want the left frequency frequency and this is gonna be equal to frequency. And uh we'll just like consider like from like the zero index to like half. And that we can express by saying this is equal to end of the length of frequency itself. And this is like divided by two. So we are uh just like considering the first half year of the frequency array and we should do the same thing for the magnitude uh array.

Answer: Now um the period is strictly correlated with a frequency. Indeed a frequency is the inverse of period. So the higher uh the period, the lower the frequency and the lower the period, the higher uh the frequency now to uh describe uh a sound wave, we also need another uh information about another thing which is indeed a amplitude and amplitude is given by the distance uh of a point uh from like zero amplitude, right? In this case, we can represent this sound wave as with a, with a sine function. And here we have a mathematical representation of this a sound wave and it's given by the A, by A which is the amplitude multiplied by the sine function uh calculated in two pi F which stands for frequency time
    Video Title: 10 - Understanding audio data for deep learning
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3XbqfIij_Y&t=145s

Answer: uh there are like a few important uh elements of a wave or a sound wave. So one is the period and the period uh gives us an idea when we have like the same, the starts like of the same uh wave. So for example, here, like we have a peak and then we go back like to the next peak. And this is like the, the period which is like the interval before like we see uh that peak again. Now um the period is strictly correlated with a frequency. Indeed a frequency is the inverse of period. So the higher uh the period, the lower the frequency and the lower the period, the higher uh the frequency now to uh describe uh a sound wave, we also need another uh information about another thing which is indeed a amplitude and amplitude is given by the distance uh of a point uh from like zero amplitude, right? In this case, we can represent this sound wave as with a, with a sine function.

    QUESTION: What is a frequency?

    CONTEXT: Answer: right? So let's go back to the waveform of our piano key and perform a fourier transform here. And so what you'll get if you perform a fourier transform is this guy over here which is called a power spectrum. So and the spectrum basically gives us the magnitude as a function of frequency. So here we know that there's a peak of like magnitude of power around 3000. Yeah, I would say like 500 like over here. So the uh the uh this frequency is very much represented like in this sound over here, right? So now, so when we do like this fourier transfer, basically we move from the time domain towards the frequency domain. What does that mean? Well, if you take a look at this waveform here, so you'll see that here we have the amplitude as a function of time. So we are in the time domain. But then when we apply the fourier transform, we move in the frequency domain because here we have on the x axis, the frequency

But then when we apply the fourier transform, we move in the frequency domain because here we have on the x axis, the frequency and the magnitude is a function of the frequency itself, right?

Answer: uh plus P. This phi is a Greek letter which stands for phase well phase. Uh what phase does to a waveform? It's basically like it shifts it to the right or to the left uh cool. OK. So now we have like a simple mathematical representation of a of a, of a waveform. So now let's look at how like sound wave uh like these two fundamental elements like of sound waves are like frequency and amplitude are connected with pitch and loudness. So frequency and pitch are connected together. Uh basically what happens is that higher frequencies are perceived as higher pitch, but pitch is not a physical uh observable. It is like a perceptual is the way we perceive uh like a frequency and we process it right. And so uh basically, the idea here is that, and you can see it here with this two sound waves like in red.

Answer: uh what we do is we call nimai dots absolute value and we pass in FFT. So basically, we are performing the absolute value on the complex values and then we end up with these magnitudes and these magnitudes indicate the contribution of each frequency bin to the overall sound. And so, and we want to map them onto like the, the relative like frequency bins, right? And for doing that, we'll do a frequent frequency, it's equal to NP five dots uh lens space. And A L space is a nice function that uh gives us a number of evenly spaced numbers in an interval,

Answer: understands like what uh the MF CCS are and how we can like use them from a very high level perspective. Well, MF CCS capture timbrel and textural aspects of sound. So if you have, for example, like a piano and a violin uh playing like the same melody, uh you would have potentially like the, the same like peach content, the same frequency and same like rhythm um more or less there depending on the performance. But what would change is like timbre the quality of sound and the MF CCS are capable of capturing that information. And for uh extracting MF CCS, we, we perform uh a fourier transform and we move like from the time domain into like the frequency domain. So MF CCS are basically like frequency domain uh feature. But the great thing, the great advantage of MF CCS over spectrograms is that they approximate the human auditory system that try to model the way

    QUESTION: How to use FFT?

    CONTEXT: Answer: uh FT or let's do violin FT where FT stands for fourier transform. And so if we're doing that, we'll use a NP dot FFT dot FFT. Now, if you feel that this FFT dot FFT is redundant, I'll tell you that this first FFT is a module that contains a bunch of different implementations of the fast forward a transform one of which is the classical FFT. So that's why you have like this double FFT thing here. OK. So here we need to pass the actual uh signal, right. So this VC four and now basically by doing so we move from the uh time domain here to the frequency domain over there. OK. So now let's take a look at this uh fourier coefficients. So, uh let's take a look at the shape of this array and we'll take it over here and we'll do a violin ft dot uh shape.

Answer: um like, I mean like in, in, in that one axis, we have around 60,000 samples and this is the number of samples that we have like in the audio file which is cool. OK. So now let's try to extract the full transform coefficients and I'll hold it for, let's say the violent sound. So we'll do a uh FT or let's do violin FT where FT stands for fourier transform. And so if we're doing that, we'll use a NP dot FFT dot FFT. Now, if you feel that this FFT dot FFT is redundant, I'll tell you that this first FFT is a module that contains a bunch of different implementations of the fast forward a transform one of which is the classical FFT.

    Video Title: How to Extract the Fourier Transform with Python
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-5uxKTRjzM&t=468s

Answer: And we do that by using uh S IP specifically the FFT module. And we use the FFT which stands for fast fourier transform um function in the FFT module. So we pass it in the signal and we get the fourier transform. Now, I'm not going to show you what that result actually is because you need to have like mm a deeper understanding of math complex numbers and things that, that which you'll have in a few videos. But for now, the important thing to understand is that if we do the absolute, if we take the absolute value of the fourier transform, we actually get the magnitudes and this is the y axis of our spectrum. Whereas on the X axis obviously, we have the frequencies. Now how should we like distribute the frequencies on the X axis? So the frequencies are gonna be between zero Hertz and the sampling rate. OK. And then we'll divide this in in a number of steps that's equal to the length of the, of the magnitude array.

Answer: So the next step is the crucial one is the one that we use for deriving the free transform. And we do that by using uh S IP specifically the FFT module. And we use the FFT which stands for fast fourier transform um function in the FFT module. So we pass it in the signal and we get the fourier transform. Now, I'm not going to show you what that result actually is because you need to have like mm a deeper understanding of math complex numbers and things that, that which you'll have in a few videos.

Answer: and then pi array now. So, and this is basically like the, the waveform associated with this audio file. And if we take a look at the shape, we're going to see that this is like a uh an array and which has like only like one dimension. And the um like, I mean like in, in, in that one axis, we have around 60,000 samples and this is the number of samples that we have like in the audio file which is cool. OK.

This function takes in the signal data and converts it from the time domain to the frequency domain. You can extract the Fourier coefficients by passing your signal to this function, which will produce an array representing the Fourier transform.

    QUESTION: How to use FFT?

    CONTEXT: Answer: uh FT or let's do violin FT where FT stands for fourier transform. And so if we're doing that, we'll use a NP dot FFT dot FFT. Now, if you feel that this FFT dot FFT is redundant, I'll tell you that this first FFT is a module that contains a bunch of different implementations of the fast forward a transform one of which is the classical FFT. So that's why you have like this double FFT thing here. OK. So here we need to pass the actual uh signal, right. So this VC four and now basically by doing so we move from the uh time domain here to the frequency domain over there. OK. So now let's take a look at this uh fourier coefficients. So, uh let's take a look at the shape of this array and we'll take it over here and we'll do a violin ft dot uh shape.

Answer: And we do that by using uh S IP specifically the FFT module. And we use the FFT which stands for fast fourier transform um function in the FFT module. So we pass it in the signal and we get the fourier transform. Now, I'm not going to show you what that result actually is because you need to have like mm a deeper understanding of math complex numbers and things that, that which you'll have in a few videos. But for now, the important thing to understand is that if we do the absolute, if we take the absolute value of the fourier transform, we actually get the magnitudes and this is the y axis of our spectrum. Whereas on the X axis obviously, we have the frequencies. Now how should we like distribute the frequencies on the X axis? So the frequencies are gonna be between zero Hertz and the sampling rate. OK. And then we'll divide this in in a number of steps that's equal to the length of the, of the magnitude array.

Answer: So the next step is the crucial one is the one that we use for deriving the free transform. And we do that by using uh S IP specifically the FFT module. And we use the FFT which stands for fast fourier transform um function in the FFT module. So we pass it in the signal and we get the fourier transform. Now, I'm not going to show you what that result actually is because you need to have like mm a deeper understanding of math complex numbers and things that, that which you'll have in a few videos. But for now, the important thing to understand is that if we do the absolute, if we take the absolute value of the fourier transform, we actually get the magnitudes and this is the y axis of our spectrum.

Answer: So 1st, 1st off, I need to define uh frames and this is gonna be equal to a range and I'll get the uh length of the say bear the BC band energy ratio uh array for the BC. And the, the length is going to be equal for the BC and the red hot chili pepper. So I can use just one. OK. So here, now I have like this value for this variable frames and now I can move on and implement T and here what I can do is use uh Libres. And uh here Libres has a nice utility function called frames to uh time. And what it it needs as arguments is the frames. And then I should

Answer: there's no free launch like in this universe. Right. And so because of that, we have like certain constraints. And so if we want for the FFT to work, then we should choose like an N wisely and N should be a power of two. That's when we have N as a power of two. That's where like the, the, the kind of like the stars align. And then we can uh kind of unleash the power of the FFT algorithm. Now this is a very important algorithm and all the stuff that we see an implementation that we use. For example, the um fourier transform when we calculate dash language nun P or Saipi or even Li Breza uh actually rely on the fast fourier transform algorithm. OK. So that's it uh like for this video. Now you should have like a very good understanding of the fourier transform. So we started with intuition of the fourier transform. We moved to like com

    QUESTION: How to use FFT?

    CONTEXT: Answer: cool. So now uh the next step is moving from the time domain. So from the the waveform uh towards the frequency domain. And to do that, we need to perform a fast four A transform. And now for performing that, we're gonna use NP. So we'll do an import NPI as MP. So, so we'll do a FFT, it's equal to NP dot FFT dot FFT. And uh we'll uh pass in the signal,
    Video Title: 11- Preprocessing audio data for Deep Learning
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa_d-zaUti8&t=306s

Answer: So, so we'll do a FFT, it's equal to NP dot FFT dot FFT. And uh we'll uh pass in the signal, right? And so what we expect here is a uh an umpire array, one dimensional array which has as many uh values as the total number of samples we have in the, in the waveform. So it's more or less like this value here. So uh 600,000 plus and at each of those values, uh we have a complex value. Now, uh I don't want to like get into the details of how we get there because like it's completely outside the scope like of and it's not needed like for deep learning. But what we want to do is we want to move like from that complex value and get the amplitude of those values and or or sorry, get the magnitude of this value and for getting the magnitude,
    Video Title: 11- Preprocessing audio data for Deep Learning
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa_d-zaUti8&t=329s

Answer: FFT, then we'll do a um mm NMFCC is equal to NMFC over here. And then we'll do a
    Video Title: 12- Music genre classification: Preparing the dataset
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szyGiObZymo&t=1225s

Answer: So how do we do that? Well, that's as simple as calling Li Brosa dots feature dot MFCC nice. And so here uh for uh calculating this, we need to pass the signal. So the original signal and then we want to pass uh a, a bunch of like different uh values uh like for example, the uh number uh like the, the, the number of samples per FFT and
    Video Title: 11- Preprocessing audio data for Deep Learning
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa_d-zaUti8&t=1252s

Answer: So we're not gonna build like any of these algorithms for like performing fourier transforms or extracting MF CCS from scratch. But rather we're gonna rely on a great audio analysis uh library called Libros. And so first thing we wanna do its import uh Libros. So, uh and as long as uh we have like not just like Libros itself but also Li Brusa dot display uh which is a nice API for visualizing uh data like spectrograms. Uh So Libres dot display is built on top of uh Maple Lib and so we want to uh import also, uh, maple lib dot PP and we'll import it as PLT. Cool. So, uh, the first thing that we want to do now is just like to, to get a file so to get an audio file. So, and I have a very nice one which is called blues 0.00000 dot wav. And yeah, let's take a look at that. So that you have an idea of what, like we'll be working on.

2024-10-12 12:17:34,418 - config - INFO - Answer from OpenAI: To use FFT, you first need to import the NumPy library as NP. Then, you can perform the FFT by assigning it to a variable, like this: `FFT = NP.FFT.FFT(signal)`, where `signal` is the waveform data you want to analyze. This will result in a one-dimensional array with complex values that correspond to the frequency components of the signal.

    QUESTION: How to use FFT?

    CONTEXT: Answer: cool. So now uh the next step is moving from the time domain. So from the the waveform uh towards the frequency domain. And to do that, we need to perform a fast four A transform. And now for performing that, we're gonna use NP. So we'll do an import NPI as MP. So, so we'll do a FFT, it's equal to NP dot FFT dot FFT. And uh we'll uh pass in the signal,

Answer: we're gonna use NP. So we'll do an import NPI as MP. So, so we'll do a FFT, it's equal to NP dot FFT dot FFT. And uh we'll uh pass in the signal, right? And so what we expect here is a uh an umpire array, one dimensional array which has as many uh values as the total number of samples we have in the, in the waveform. So it's more or less like this value here. So uh 600,000 plus and at each of those values, uh we have a complex value. Now,

So it's more or less like this value here. So uh 600,000 plus and at each of those values, uh we have a complex value. Now, uh I don't want to like get into the details of how we get there because like it's completely outside the scope like of and it's not needed like for deep learning. But what we want to do is we want to move like from that complex value and get the amplitude of those values and or or sorry, get the magnitude of this value and for getting the magnitude,
    Video Title: 11- Preprocessing audio data for Deep Learning
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa_d-zaUti8&t=329s

Answer: um the energy of the different frequency beams throughout the whole sound. And we, what we want to do is like understanding how this uh frequencies are contributing to the overall sound throughout time. So in order to do that we need to do a short time uh for transform an SSTFT and get a spectrogram. So the spectrogram is gonna give us information about the amplitude as a function of both frequency and time. So how do we get a Stft? Well, we use libros for that. So we do libros dot core and then we call Stft nice. And uh here uh we should pass a few uh different values. So first of all, obviously, we need to fasten the, the signal, but then there are another couple of values. So one, it's, we can call it an uh number of samples per FFT.

2024-10-12 12:17:49,065 - config - INFO - Answer from OpenAI: To use FFT, you first need to import NumPy as NP. Then, you can perform the FFT by assigning it to a variable using the command `FFT = NP. FFT. FFT(signal)`, where `signal` is the data you want to transform. This will give you a one-dimensional array containing complex values corresponding to the frequencies in the original signal.

    QUESTION: Could you describe FFT approach?

    CONTEXT: Answer: So if you look at this, you could say, well, if we have here like on the y axis, so like the amplitude is more than 0.2 or less than minus 0.2 then probably have an onset, right? And so we could use just like this very basic rule and then we would end up with this uh results. So we would be able to identify all of these guys like here, like vertical bars in red. And obviously, as you can see here, there are certain things that uh can't be identified and are like this smaller uh outbursts of energy here because like they are less than 0.2 or uh like in, in terms of like amplitude. And so we, we don't cover those with our simple rule, right? But this is like a an expert based approach. So we provided the rules to the system and the system has learned uh basically just like by what we we told it, told it to do,
    Video Title: 2- AI, machine learning and deep learning
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LLxZ35ru_g&t=462s

Answer: And basically what we do with a fourier transform is like the process of decomposing a periodic sound into a sum of sine waves which all vibrate oscillate like at different frequencies. So think about that, this is like quite incredible. So we can describe a very complex sound as long as it's periodic as a sum as the super imposition of a bunch of different sine waves and different frequencies. Like it's quite remarkable, isn't it cool? So, but let's like try to like uh visualize this because this could feel I know a little bit abstract. So let's start like with this uh sound wave over here.
    Video Title: 10 - Understanding audio data for deep learning
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3XbqfIij_Y&t=620s

Answer: and it uses deep neural networks. So what's a deep neural network is a neural network that has more than one hidden layer? So that's it. So this is deep learning basically. So using deep neural nets for solving all sorts of like very complicated problems and basically, throughout this series of videos, we're gonna be uh just like coding um uh deep neural nets and we're gonna be seeing like different flavors of like neural nets. Cool. So now let's take a look at the actual differences between traditional machine learning and deep learning. So the the main one that comes to mind is that in traditional machine learning, you have, you do a lot of feature engineering. Whereas in deep learning, you have another type of approach which is more end to end. So what do you mean by that? So let me explain because it could be like a little bit like tough, like to understand. So

Answer: um uh deep neural nets and we're gonna be seeing like different flavors of like neural nets. Cool. So now let's take a look at the actual differences between traditional machine learning and deep learning. So the the main one that comes to mind is that in traditional machine learning, you have, you do a lot of feature engineering. Whereas in deep learning, you have another type of approach which is more end to end. So what do you mean by that? So let me explain because it could be like a little bit like tough, like to understand. So uh let's let's focus a little bit like on feature engineering. So as we said, like in supervised learning. What we usually do is like we pass a lot of like label data to uh a machine learning algorithm and the algorithm uh learns and extracts like the rules from the data. But uh when I, when I mentioned supervised learning, uh first I ignored

Answer: uh given by Russell and Norvig in a book that's basically a Bible for artificial intelligence. And the book is called Artificial Intelligence and modern approach. And so the two scholars define A I as the the designing and building of intelligent agents that receive percept from the environment and take actions that affect the environment. So basically for the, for these guys for Russell and Norvig A I is just like the the creation, the science and the art of building like these intelligent agents. But then obviously one could ask but wait a minute, what's an intelligent agent? So here it seems that we are shifting the definition of artificial intelligence towards that of like an intelligence

    QUESTION: Could you describe FFT approach?

    CONTEXT: Answer: So, so we'll do a FFT, it's equal to NP dot FFT dot FFT. And uh we'll uh pass in the signal, right? And so what we expect here is a uh an umpire array, one dimensional array which has as many uh values as the total number of samples we have in the, in the waveform. So it's more or less like this value here. So uh 600,000 plus and at each of those values, uh we have a complex value. Now, uh I don't want to like get into the details of how we get there because like it's completely outside the scope like of and it's not needed like for deep learning. But what we want to do is we want to move like from that complex value and get the amplitude of those values and or or sorry, get the magnitude of this value and for getting the magnitude,

Answer: So again, using MF CCS is another way of like doing end to end uh deep learning with audio and it's like a very efficient one, effective one cool. So this was it for this video. So what's up next? Well, uh it turns out that like in this video, we spent quite a lot of time talking about theoretical stuff. And now as usual, so as we usually do, we, we want just like to turn like this theoretical uh information into like implementation. So in the next video, we'll perform fast fourier transforms a short term, short time via transform. Uh with Python, we'll look at spectrograms at spectra and we'll extract MF CCS. But again, we won't implement uh these extractors like from scratch. But R will get familiar with a fantastic audio library in Python that's called uh Li Brosa. And that's like a library that you really want to know if you want to use if you want to like do stuff like in um audio

Answer: Cool. So now again, so as you've seen, I haven't gone into like the deep mathematical details or implementation details, both of like the fourier transform and MF CCS because we don't need them. But again, if you are like interested in knowing more, just like let me know in the comments section. And once I'm done like with the series, uh I could actually like make a few videos about this and if you are very interested in that I could actually create a series about all your digital signal processing, which is a fascinating topic in itself and very complex. Cool. OK. So now how do we use like MF CCS like in the uh preprocessing pipeline? Like for a data? Well, it's basically the same thing that we do like for a spectrogram. So we start from a, a waveform, a sound form
    Video Title: 10 - Understanding audio data for deep learning
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3XbqfIij_Y&t=1816s

Answer: uh to extract like this features like it's quite complicated and I'm not gonna get like into the details because again, we we don't need them. So we need to understand like the intuition between like a spectrogram and MF CCS. But we don't need to like understand the implementation details here. But what we need to do however, is to understands like what uh the MF CCS are and how we can like use them from a very high level perspective. Well, MF CCS capture timbrel and textural aspects of sound. So if you have, for example, like a piano and a violin uh playing like the same melody, uh you would have potentially like the, the same like peach content, the same frequency and same like rhythm um more or less there depending on the performance. But what would change is like timbre the quality of sound and the MF CCS are capable of capturing that information.

    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3XbqfIij_Y&t=1565s

Answer: And uh here uh we should pass a few uh different values. So first of all, obviously, we need to fasten the, the signal, but then there are another couple of values. So one, it's, we can call it an uh number of samples per FFT. And uh we are gonna set this to 2048 and this is expressed in a number of samples. And so this is basically like the window uh that we are considering when um uh performing a single uh fourier transform, fast fourier transform, right. So we are considering this amount of samples and then there's another value

2024-10-12 12:18:29,406 - config - INFO - Answer from OpenAI: The FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) approach involves using the NumPy library to compute the FFT of a signal. When performing a FFT, you pass in a one-dimensional array representing the signal, which contains as many values as there are samples in the waveform. The output is a complex array, and the goal is to derive the amplitude or magnitude from these complex values. The process does not delve into the deep mathematical details, focusing instead on the practical aspects necessary for applications like deep learning.

    QUESTION: Could you describe FFT approach?

    CONTEXT: Answer: uh FT or let's do violin FT where FT stands for fourier transform. And so if we're doing that, we'll use a NP dot FFT dot FFT. Now, if you feel that this FFT dot FFT is redundant, I'll tell you that this first FFT is a module that contains a bunch of different implementations of the fast forward a transform one of which is the classical FFT. So that's why you have like this double FFT thing here. OK. So here we need to pass the actual uh signal, right. So this VC four and now basically by doing so we move from the uh time domain here to the frequency domain over there. OK. So now let's take a look at this uh fourier coefficients. So, uh let's take a look at the shape of this array and we'll take it over here and we'll do a violin ft dot uh shape.

    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-5uxKTRjzM&t=493s

Answer: And we do that by using uh S IP specifically the FFT module. And we use the FFT which stands for fast fourier transform um function in the FFT module. So we pass it in the signal and we get the fourier transform. Now, I'm not going to show you what that result actually is because you need to have like mm a deeper understanding of math complex numbers and things that, that which you'll have in a few videos. But for now, the important thing to understand is that if we do the absolute, if we take the absolute value of the fourier transform, we actually get the magnitudes and this is the y axis of our spectrum. Whereas on the X axis obviously, we have the frequencies. Now how should we like distribute the frequencies on the X axis? So the frequencies are gonna be between zero Hertz and the sampling rate. OK. And then we'll divide this in in a number of steps that's equal to the length of the, of the magnitude array.

Answer: So the next step is the crucial one is the one that we use for deriving the free transform. And we do that by using uh S IP specifically the FFT module. And we use the FFT which stands for fast fourier transform um function in the FFT module. So we pass it in the signal and we get the fourier transform. Now, I'm not going to show you what that result actually is because you need to have like mm a deeper understanding of math complex numbers and things that, that which you'll have in a few videos.

Answer: then we can uh kind of unleash the power of the FFT algorithm. Now this is a very important algorithm and all the stuff that we see an implementation that we use. For example, the um fourier transform when we calculate dash language nun P or Saipi or even Li Breza uh actually rely on the fast fourier transform algorithm. OK. So that's it uh like for this video. Now you should have like a very good understanding of the fourier transform. So we started with intuition of the fourier transform. We moved to like com complex numbers and understood how we can actually use complex numbers for defining the fourier transform in a continuous context. Now, you know about the discrete version of the fourier transform. So you may be wondering

    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUi_jdOyxIQ&t=1441s

Answer: there's no free launch like in this universe. Right. And so because of that, we have like certain constraints. And so if we want for the FFT to work, then we should choose like an N wisely and N should be a power of two. That's when we have N as a power of two. That's where like the, the, the kind of like the stars align. And then we can uh kind of unleash the power of the FFT algorithm. Now this is a very important algorithm and all the stuff that we see an implementation that we use. For example, the um fourier transform when we calculate dash language nun P or Saipi or even Li Breza uh actually rely on the fast fourier transform algorithm. OK.

By applying the FFT function to the signal, we can transition from the time domain to the frequency domain. The absolute value of the Fourier transform yields the magnitudes, which represent the y-axis of the spectrum, while the x-axis corresponds to the frequencies ranging from zero Hertz up to the sampling rate, distributed in steps equal to the length of the magnitude array.

    QUESTION: Could you describe how to get Mel-Spectrogram?

    CONTEXT: Answer: Hey everybody and welcome to a new exciting video and the audio signal processing for machine learning series. This time we'll be looking into mel spectrograms. This is a flavor of spectrograms that is extensively used in A I audio research and A I audio real world applications. But before we get started into mel spectrograms, I want to give you an overview of what we did over the last couple of videos and that is the short time fourier transform. And we also looked into extracting and visualizing spectrograms. Now, if you're not familiar with this concept, I highly suggest you to go check out my previous two videos, cos what I'm going to say next in the video builds on top of this two notions extensively. Now without further ado let's move on to this visualization of a spectrogram. And as you can see here on the X axis, we have time on the Y axis. As usual we have uh frequency and each point which is represented by a color in this two D representation uh tells us how present a certain frequency is at each point in time.

Answer: So extracting mel spectrograms is as easy in Libres as running libros dot T dash mel spectrogram. Now, if you remember uh from my previous video, well, extracting or calculating me spectrograms, uh it's kind of like quite convoluted process because what you should do is actually extracting spectrogram first vanilla spectrograms then uh uh creating a male filter bank and then apply mail filter banks to the spectrograms. And that's actually what these uh libre dot feature dot males spectrogram function does under the hood. And indeed what you should do here is pass information for both extracting um the uh like vanilla spectrogram as well as the co creating like a male uh filter back. So we pass in the the signal. So in this case, it's our scale signal. Then we should specify the some the frame size, the H length. And these are

    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnVE5m3o_0&t=409s

Answer: OK. So now uh let's take a look at the mel spectrogram. So the mel spectrogram is a metric, a metric itself and its shape is given by the number of bands. So we have like the as many number of as many rows as the number of bands that we chose and uh on, on the number of columns that we have is equal to the number of frames of the original spectrograms. OK. So in other words, if you think about this like this uh multiplication here, so applying male filter banks to the spectrogram, what enabled us to do is basically to convert the frequencies just from Hertz to male bands. OK. And that's the whole point of a male spectrogram. And the cool thing now is that we are, we are using uh male bands which are kind of psychologically uh relevant in terms of the way we perceive pitch. OK. But now let's take a look at what this means in terms of like a visual representation. And well, if you're familiar with spectrograms, well, mouse spectrograms are no different at all.

    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GHCiiDLHQ4&t=1539s

Answer: the uh like vanilla spectrogram as well as the co creating like a male uh filter back. So we pass in the the signal. So in this case, it's our scale signal. Then we should specify the some the frame size, the H length. And these are uh this is all the information that we need for extracting the spectrogram. And then we also need to pass the number of male bands which yeah, let's put it just like equal to 90 for example, right? And as I said, what ma spectrogram does under the hood is calculating the uh vanilla spectrogram. It creates the male filter banks and apply the male filter banks uh to the spectrogram. OK. So let's run this. And next, what I want to show you guys is the shape of this um males spectrogram, right?

Answer: across different genres, like when you like, look at their spectrogram. So you can have like a, a fair guess if you're experienced in uh visual spectrograms, whether like you're dealing with a classical music, kind of like peace or you're dealing with a, a rock uh like ballad or whatever, that's all for today. I hope you enjoyed the video. Next time we're gonna move on to another flavor of spectrograms called male spectrograms, which are more psychological perceptually relevant than the royal spectrograms that we've seen here. So if you've enjoyed the video and found it useful, please leave a like if you haven't subscribed and you would like to see more videos like this. Well, just subscribe to the channel and if you have any questions as always, just like, leave them in the comments section below. I hope I'll see you next time. Cheers.

Then, you create a Mel filter bank and apply it to the spectrogram. In practice, this can be done using the function `librosa.feature.melspectrogram`, where you pass the audio signal, specify the frame size, and the hop length, as well as the number of Mel bands you want to use.

    QUESTION: Could you describe how to get Mel-Spectrogram?

    CONTEXT: Answer: uh moving on, uh I want to show you the male filter banks before we extract the mel spectrogram from this audio file. So if you remember from my previous video on mel spectrograms, male filter banks are really the key to getting to male spectrograms because what we do is we extract the spectrogram kind of like a vanilla spectrogram and then we apply a male filter bank to it. In other words, we do a matrix multiplication between the male filter banks and the vanilla spectrogram. And what we get is the uh male spectrogram. OK. So now let's take a look at the at how we can extract this uh filter banks. Well, if you remember I gave you like all the the five different steps we we we should put into place to, to create a male filter bank. But the great thing about Libras is that we have a utility function that does all of that for us so that we
    Video Title: Extracting Mel Spectrograms with Python
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnVE5m3o_0&t=96s

Answer: So for example, let's analyze like this second uh mel band over here. So this is like the kind of like the the center point, the center frequency where we have which that's equal to one. And then the farther we move from the center frequency of this mel band and like the the lower the weights, which basically means like that the colors tend to fade out and then uh outside of the extremity we have like pitch black, which basically means that which is always like equal to zero. And then here you can actually see induction like this filter, um triangular filters, right? Uh for all of this uh different male bands. So yeah, um let's move on now to extracting mouse spectrograms now that we know, yeah, how to extract male filter banks and how to, yeah, just visualize them. OK. So extracting mel spectrograms is as easy in Libres as running libros dot T dash mel spectrogram. Now, if you remember uh from my previous video, well, extracting or calculating me spectrograms, uh it's kind of like quite convoluted process because what you should do is actually extracting spectrogram first vanilla spectrograms then

But the great thing about Libras is that we have a utility function that does all of that for us so that we can then just like get a, a whole filter bank. So we do uh a Li Breza dot filters dot mail and then we should pass some parameters. First of all, we pass the frame size which I've put to 2048 the simple rate and the number of malls that we want to use. And in other words, like this is like kind of like the number of like mel bands that we'll uh see. OK,
    Video Title: Extracting Mel Spectrograms with Python
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnVE5m3o_0&t=106s

Answer: OK. So next up what we wanna do is just like a uh yeah load uh this audio file in Li Brosa. And so for that, and you should be familiar with this right now. We do a Li Brosa dot load and we pass in the path to the file. What we get back is a signal uh which is just like an empire array and then ad sample rate and the default sample rate with libros is 22,050 Hertz. OK. So uh moving on, uh I want to show you the male filter banks before we extract the mel spectrogram from this audio file.

    QUESTION: Could you describe how to get Mel-Spectrogram?

    CONTEXT: Answer: So think about that, this is like quite incredible. So we can describe a very complex sound as long as it's periodic as a sum as the super imposition of a bunch of different sine waves and different frequencies. Like it's quite remarkable, isn't it cool? So, but let's like try to like uh visualize this because this could feel I know a little bit abstract. So let's start like with this uh sound wave over here. Now this uh sound wave is given by the super imposition of these two sine waves, right? So if we sum them, we're gonna get this, which is quite cool. So let's see this like uh mathematically.

Answer: I would say like uh around a very like low frequency here could be like 500 something like that like Hertz, right? And as you see here, uh this uh spectrogram resembles a little bit of the waveform of the piano key as well because as you see, like in time, like all of these frequencies are kind of like fading out like the energy for these frequencies because like the time the the sound of the piano key is just like fading out uh all the time cool. OK. So now we have like an idea of like what a spectrogram is, but let's see how we perform a short time fourier transform a little bit like more in detail. Um just like to understand like how this works. So here we start obviously from a um a waveform like the the mm
    Video Title: 10 - Understanding audio data for deep learning
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3XbqfIij_Y&t=1133s

Answer: uh I could actually like make a few videos about this and if you are very interested in that I could actually create a series about all your digital signal processing, which is a fascinating topic in itself and very complex. Cool. OK. So now how do we use like MF CCS like in the uh preprocessing pipeline? Like for a data? Well, it's basically the same thing that we do like for a spectrogram. So we start from a, a waveform, a sound form a sound wave, then we extract MF CCS. Now we have these MF CCS and we pass the MF CCS directly into our deep learning um uh network, right?

Answer: a very like low frequency here could be like 500 something like that like Hertz, right? And as you see here, uh this uh spectrogram resembles a little bit of the waveform of the piano key as well because as you see, like in time, like all of these frequencies are kind of like fading out like the energy for these frequencies because like the time the the sound of the piano key is just like fading out uh all the time cool. OK. So now we have like an idea of like what a spectrogram is, but let's see how we perform a short time fourier transform a little bit like more in detail. Um just like to understand like how this works. So here we start obviously from a um a waveform like the the mm sound wave. And then what we do next is we basically like focus only on uh one frame which is given by a number of samples here. And then what we do next is we calculate the, the fourier transform over here. And then we take this information and we just project it in the spectrogram.

    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3XbqfIij_Y&t=1137s

Answer: And if you guys re recall the uh the waveform, like, it was like quite, I would say, like quite stable, like throughout and like, and that could have been a little bit like of a, of a hint into also like the, the way uh like the the spectrogram like would behave to a certain extent. And obviously like what we see here is that like the spectrogram remains like quite stable throughout time. Cool. OK. So now we've seen uh like the spectrogram, the log spectrogram. Now we want to calculate the last thing. So we want to extract the MF CCS.

Then you perform a Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) on this waveform to obtain frequency information. Afterward, you project this information into the spectrogram format, and from there, you can extract the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) if needed.

    QUESTION: How to extract MFCC?

    CONTEXT: Answer: of a hint into also like the, the way uh like the the spectrogram like would behave to a certain extent. And obviously like what we see here is that like the spectrogram remains like quite stable throughout time. Cool. OK. So now we've seen uh like the spectrogram, the log spectrogram. Now we want to calculate the last thing. So we want to extract the MF CCS. So how do we do that? Well, that's as simple as calling Li Brosa dots feature dot MFCC

Answer: Cool. OK. So now we've seen uh like the spectrogram, the log spectrogram. Now we want to calculate the last thing. So we want to extract the MF CCS. So how do we do that? Well, that's as simple as calling Li Brosa dots feature dot MFCC nice. And so here uh for uh calculating this, we need to pass the signal. So the original signal and then we want to pass uh a, a bunch of like different uh values uh like for example, the uh number
    Video Title: 11- Preprocessing audio data for Deep Learning
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa_d-zaUti8&t=1240s

Answer: But now we can't just analyze and extract the MF CCS like at this level because uh we want to like analyze and extract MF CCS at the level of the segments, right? And so now we need to like divide like this signal into a bunch of different uh segments. And so what we need to do here is to process uh segments, extracting MFCC and uh storing uh yeah, the data, right.

Answer: uh rates is equal to 2 22,000 uh 50 which is a customary uh value for sample rate when we do music processing. OK. And so now we've uh loaded the uh audio file, OK? But now we can't just analyze and extract the MF CCS like at this level because uh we want to like analyze and extract MF CCS at the level of the segments, right? And so now we need to like divide like this signal into a bunch of different uh segments. And so what we need to do here is to process uh segments, extracting MFCC and uh storing

    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szyGiObZymo&t=1015s

Answer: and on the X axis we have time. And so we basically see here how, how the different MF CCS are evolving over time. And once again, like the, the MFCC like plots is quite stable. Cool. OK. So we basically went through all the stuff that we need for preprocessing audio data for deep learning. Now, you know how to look at it at the waveform, how to extract like signal from a wave file, how to perform a fourier transform, how to arrive at a power spectrum spectrograms, log spectrograms, and most importantly MF CCS, which we're gonna be using in the next video where we're gonna do something super exciting. So we're gonna use an M LP, a multi-layered perception for uh classifying music genres. So we're gonna have a data set of uh short experts of uh music and we're gonna classify uh the type of like genres like they belong to. Cool. I hope you really like enjoyed this uh video.

    QUESTION: How to extract MFCC?

    CONTEXT: Answer: And yes. And so here we have the sampling rate and here we have the signal. So let's take a look at the uh signal over here at the shape of the signal. And as you can see, we have this amount of samples uh in this uh waveform. Next step for us is extracting MF CCS, extract NF CCS. OK. So how do we do that? Well, this is extremely simple in Li Brosa because we have a function that does dash uh almost for free for us. So MS CC is equal to libros dot feature. And then MFCC like this and we want to pass in the signal, specify the number of MF CCS and we'll use like a traditional number which is equal to 13 and then specify the sampling rate like this. OK. Let's do this. OK? So here we have the MF CCS. Now, now let's take a look at the uh the shape of this MF CCS. And so this should be a dimensional array or a matrix. And so we'll do MF CCS dot shape.

Answer: good. So the next thing that we wanna do, we want to actually load the uh the audio file using a li browser. And so, uh again, this is something that we've done multiple times. So we'll take the signal and the sampling rate over here and then we'll do a Lisa dot load. And then what we wanna pass is the audio file over here. And yes. And so here we have the sampling rate and here we have the signal. So let's take a look at the uh signal over here at the shape of the signal. And as you can see, we have this amount of samples uh in this uh waveform. Next step for us is extracting MF CCS, extract NF CCS. OK. So how do we do that?

Answer: features and you're gonna be able to extract these features from rare audio. Most importantly, you recognize what are your audio features to use in your audio ML applications. So what makes the most sense for different types of applications? And along with that throughout this series, we're gonna, I'm gonna show you how to preprocess all your data and make it ready for your uh deep learning applications. OK? And then there's uh a thing that's very dear to me. So I'm gonna cover a little bit of math uh behind all the audio transformations that we're gonna uh touch upon. And I think that's very important for you to understand that so that, you know, really dd down what uh like audio features are and how we can extract them and how you can uh basically uh trick the parameters for extracting those features in a way that makes the most sense for your problem. And finally, on top of that, obviously, you're gonna be able to use a lib browser efficiently so that you can extract all the features that you need for your audio ML projects.

Answer: earlier. In other words, the lifting or a lifter, what we want to use here is a low pass lifter, which is basically a nice way of saying that we want a low pass filter that's just gonna remove all the values are related to the high uh equivalences. OK. And so once we do that, we remain only if the SES coefficients connected to the spectral envelope, which is the stuff that we wanted. Now that we know about the subs we can move on and understand what male frequency subs coefficients are. The cool thing is that MFCC is built on top of sere. So that is gonna be a piece of cake for us. The best way we can understand how MFC work is by looking at how we can compute them. And this is a multi step process. Many of the steps are shared by how we compute SERE and MFCC. So let's get started. We begin with a simple waveform. So signal in the time domain, as usual we apply the full transform and we get a spectrum out of that. Next step is to apply a logarithm to the amplitude so that we get a log spectrum.

And up until this point, the process for getting subs stream and male frequency subst coefficients is actually the same right. But here we have the first divergence. So what we do next is applying mel scaling. What this means is that we take the log spectrum and we apply the mall filter banks which are these triangular filters like this, right? So if you followed along

    QUESTION: How to extract MFCC?

    CONTEXT: Answer: of a hint into also like the, the way uh like the the spectrogram like would behave to a certain extent. And obviously like what we see here is that like the spectrogram remains like quite stable throughout time. Cool. OK. So now we've seen uh like the spectrogram, the log spectrogram. Now we want to calculate the last thing. So we want to extract the MF CCS. So how do we do that? Well, that's as simple as calling Li Brosa dots feature dot MFCC

Answer: Cool. OK. So now we've seen uh like the spectrogram, the log spectrogram. Now we want to calculate the last thing. So we want to extract the MF CCS. So how do we do that? Well, that's as simple as calling Li Brosa dots feature dot MFCC nice. And so here uh for uh calculating this, we need to pass the signal. So the original signal and then we want to pass uh a, a bunch of like different uh values uh like for example, the uh number
    Video Title: 11- Preprocessing audio data for Deep Learning
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa_d-zaUti8&t=1240s

Answer: But now we can't just analyze and extract the MF CCS like at this level because uh we want to like analyze and extract MF CCS at the level of the segments, right? And so now we need to like divide like this signal into a bunch of different uh segments. And so what we need to do here is to process uh segments, extracting MFCC and uh storing uh yeah, the data, right.

Answer: uh rates is equal to 2 22,000 uh 50 which is a customary uh value for sample rate when we do music processing. OK. And so now we've uh loaded the uh audio file, OK? But now we can't just analyze and extract the MF CCS like at this level because uh we want to like analyze and extract MF CCS at the level of the segments, right? And so now we need to like divide like this signal into a bunch of different uh segments. And so what we need to do here is to process uh segments, extracting MFCC and uh storing

    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szyGiObZymo&t=1015s

Answer: and on the X axis we have time. And so we basically see here how, how the different MF CCS are evolving over time. And once again, like the, the MFCC like plots is quite stable. Cool. OK. So we basically went through all the stuff that we need for preprocessing audio data for deep learning. Now, you know how to look at it at the waveform, how to extract like signal from a wave file, how to perform a fourier transform, how to arrive at a power spectrum spectrograms, log spectrograms, and most importantly MF CCS, which we're gonna be using in the next video where we're gonna do something super exciting. So we're gonna use an M LP, a multi-layered perception for uh classifying music genres. So we're gonna have a data set of uh short experts of uh music and we're gonna classify uh the type of like genres like they belong to. Cool. I hope you really like enjoyed this uh video.

    QUESTION: How to extract features from audio signal?

    CONTEXT: Answer: um ML algorithms is we extract features from the data itself. So in this case, for example, from a waveform, we can extract certain features like zero crossing rates or spectral flux or a bunch of other features. So we extract these features first and then we pass those features into uh the machine learning algorithm and then the machine algorithm uh uh at the ML algorithm, hopefully we'll be able to uh extracts the rules, figure out the rules for doing like this classification problem now. So like in feature engineering like and traditional machine learning, it's very important to understand which features are important for describing a certain problem. So we start from the road data, we extract certain features and we use those features for doing training and then inference obviously. So

Answer: on purpose, obviously a an important part of this that happens in traditional machine learning, which is like feature engineering. So let's go back to the idea uh to the example of like extracting onsets or identifying onsets from waveforms. So in that case, what we want to do if we are using, for example, super vector machines or like this more traditional um ML algorithms is we extract features from the data itself. So in this case, for example, from a waveform, we can extract certain features like zero crossing rates or spectral flux or a bunch of other features. So we extract these features first and then we pass those features into uh the machine learning algorithm and then the machine algorithm uh uh at the ML algorithm, hopefully we'll be able to

Answer: uh let's let's focus a little bit like on feature engineering. So as we said, like in supervised learning. What we usually do is like we pass a lot of like label data to uh a machine learning algorithm and the algorithm uh learns and extracts like the rules from the data. But uh when I, when I mentioned supervised learning, uh first I ignored on purpose, obviously a an important part of this that happens in traditional machine learning, which is like feature engineering. So let's go back to the idea uh to the example of like extracting onsets or identifying onsets from waveforms. So in that case, what we want to do if we are using, for example, super vector machines or like this more traditional um ML algorithms is we extract features from the data itself.

Answer: and but this is like important to understand. So we we start with low level features and then while we move from one convolution layer to the next we abstract higher level features. Cool. And so this is like an intuition how a CNN architecture uh works? Cool. OK. So now you may be wondering, OK, so we've spent so much time on talking about how wonderful CNN S are with images. So what about audio? After all, we are talking about deep learning for audio like in this uh uh series, right? Yeah. But uh the great thing is that uh we can think of audio in a sense itself as a, as an image, right? So if you guys remember, so what we usually use when we um use deep learning like audio. Uh we we use like spectrograms, we use MF CCS all of this type of like features, but now we've already like visualize them like as an image. And at the end of the day, these are big, we can be interpreted as images, right? Both the spectrogram and the MF CCS, right?

Answer: So the pixels are not just like randomly like uh positions like in an image, but usually there are certain emergent structures. So for example, you have structures like edges shapes, you have invariants to translation, you have scale invariants So for example, a square remains a square, square re regardless of how big the square is, right? And in a sense like what we do with CNN S is we try to emulate the way we see stuff and we perceive like images, right? And uh by doing so what we do when we, when we see like stuff, it's basically we extract uh basic features. So for example, we we are able to extract when we see something like vertical bars or horizontal bars. And in a sense, all the different components of A CNN try to uh learn to extract different uh types of features. So

    QUESTION: How to extract features from audio signal?

    CONTEXT: Answer: um I just want to remind you about how we can extract frequent frequency domain uh features in a nutshell in a very simplistic way. What we do is we start from the waveform, then we apply a short time fourier transform and so that we get a spectrogram. And then at this point, we can compute a feature computation so that we can arrive at a feature. Now, as I said, this is a simplification of the whole process and I have a whole video that details how to extract audio features in general and the frequency domain audio features specifically. So I highly suggest you to go check out that video. Then another thing that is gonna be a required for this video if you want to really understand it is the understanding of short time fourier transform and the understanding of what a spectrogram is. Now, once again, I have a bunch of videos on that. So just go check them out in this series. I just want to share a couple of math conventions that we'll be using during the video. So the first one is this MTON
    Video Title: Frequency-Domain Audio Features
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-bjAoAxQ9o&t=86s

Answer: OK. So now this is a way a strategy that we can use to classify all your features. But let's review another strategy and this is the temporal scope and this strategy applies to any type of sound music or non music. And so here we can uh kind of like divide the audio features into like three categories. So we have audio features that are focused that give us informa instantaneous information about the audio signal. And basically like this consider very short chunks of audio signal, which usually is around like 50 to 100 milliseconds or like 20 to 100 milliseconds like something like that. So it's like almost like instantaneous information here, it is important to uh like uh remember that the kind of like minimal resolution, temporal resolution that we human beings are capable of appreciating is around 10 milliseconds. So we can really go below that threshold because otherwise, I mean, it, it wouldn't make any sense for us on a perceptual level.

    QUESTION: How to extract Mel-Spectrogram?

    CONTEXT: Answer: So extracting mel spectrograms is as easy in Libres as running libros dot T dash mel spectrogram. Now, if you remember uh from my previous video, well, extracting or calculating me spectrograms, uh it's kind of like quite convoluted process because what you should do is actually extracting spectrogram first vanilla spectrograms then uh uh creating a male filter bank and then apply mail filter banks to the spectrograms. And that's actually what these uh libre dot feature dot males spectrogram function does under the hood. And indeed what you should do here is pass information for both extracting um the uh like vanilla spectrogram as well as the co creating like a male uh filter back. So we pass in the the signal. So in this case, it's our scale signal. Then we should specify the some the frame size, the H length. And these are

Answer: we have like pitch black, which basically means that which is always like equal to zero. And then here you can actually see induction like this filter, um triangular filters, right? Uh for all of this uh different male bands. So yeah, um let's move on now to extracting mouse spectrograms now that we know, yeah, how to extract male filter banks and how to, yeah, just visualize them. OK.

Answer: Hey everybody and welcome to a new exciting video and the audio signal processing for machine learning series. This time we'll be looking into mel spectrograms. This is a flavor of spectrograms that is extensively used in A I audio research and A I audio real world applications. But before we get started into mel spectrograms, I want to give you an overview of what we did over the last couple of videos and that is the short time fourier transform. And we also looked into extracting and visualizing spectrograms. Now, if you're not familiar with this concept, I highly suggest you to go check out my previous two videos, cos what I'm going to say next in the video builds on top of this two notions extensively. Now without further ado let's move on to this visualization of a spectrogram. And as you can see here on the X axis, we have time on the Y axis. As usual we have uh frequency and each point which is represented by a color in this two D representation uh tells us how present a certain frequency is at each point in time.

Answer: uh moving on, uh I want to show you the male filter banks before we extract the mel spectrogram from this audio file. So if you remember from my previous video on mel spectrograms, male filter banks are really the key to getting to male spectrograms because what we do is we extract the spectrogram kind of like a vanilla spectrogram and then we apply a male filter bank to it. In other words, we do a matrix multiplication between the male filter banks and the vanilla spectrogram. And what we get is the uh male spectrogram. OK. So now let's take a look at the at how we can extract this uh filter banks. Well, if you remember I gave you like all the the five different steps we we we should put into place to, to create a male filter bank. But the great thing about Libras is that we have a utility function that does all of that for us so that we
    Video Title: Extracting Mel Spectrograms with Python
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnVE5m3o_0&t=96s

Answer: uh this is all the information that we need for extracting the spectrogram. And then we also need to pass the number of male bands which yeah, let's put it just like equal to 90 for example, right? And as I said, what ma spectrogram does under the hood is calculating the uh vanilla spectrogram. It creates the male filter banks and apply the male filter banks uh to the spectrogram. OK. So let's run this. And next, what I want to show you guys is the shape of this um males spectrogram, right? And so what we get here is a, a bi dimensional ray uh once again and the shape here is like, so the the, the first dimension has like size equal to 90. And this checks out because the, the number of rays that we have in the mount spectrogram hm uh should be equal to the number of um mel bands and in this case is equal to 90. So it checks out and this second dimension

    Video Title: Extracting Mel Spectrograms with Python
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnVE5m3o_0&t=96s

Answer: So for example, let's analyze like this second uh mel band over here. So this is like the kind of like the the center point, the center frequency where we have which that's equal to one. And then the farther we move from the center frequency of this mel band and like the the lower the weights, which basically means like that the colors tend to fade out and then uh outside of the extremity we have like pitch black, which basically means that which is always like equal to zero. And then here you can actually see induction like this filter, um triangular filters, right? Uh for all of this uh different male bands. So yeah, um let's move on now to extracting mouse spectrograms now that we know, yeah, how to extract male filter banks and how to, yeah, just visualize them. OK. So extracting mel spectrograms is as easy in Libres as running libros dot T dash mel spectrogram. Now, if you remember uh from my previous video, well, extracting or calculating me spectrograms, uh it's kind of like quite convoluted process because what you should do is actually extracting spectrogram first vanilla spectrograms then

    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdnVE5m3o_0&t=383s

Answer: OK. So next up what we wanna do is just like a uh yeah load uh this audio file in Li Brosa. And so for that, and you should be familiar with this right now. We do a Li Brosa dot load and we pass in the path to the file. What we get back is a signal uh which is just like an empire array and then ad sample rate and the default sample rate with libros is 22,050 Hertz. OK.

So we do uh a Li Breza dot filters dot mail and then we should pass some parameters. First of all, we pass the frame size which I've put to 2048 the simple rate and the number of malls that we want to use. And in other words, like this is like kind of like the number of like mel bands that we'll uh see. OK,

    QUESTION: Could you describe FFT approach?

    CONTEXT: Answer: uh FT or let's do violin FT where FT stands for fourier transform. And so if we're doing that, we'll use a NP dot FFT dot FFT. Now, if you feel that this FFT dot FFT is redundant, I'll tell you that this first FFT is a module that contains a bunch of different implementations of the fast forward a transform one of which is the classical FFT. So that's why you have like this double FFT thing here. OK. So here we need to pass the actual uh signal, right. So this VC four and now basically by doing so we move from the uh time domain here to the frequency domain over there. OK. So now let's take a look at this uh fourier coefficients. So, uh let's take a look at the shape of this array and we'll take it over here and we'll do a violin ft dot uh shape.

    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-5uxKTRjzM&t=493s

Answer: um like, I mean like in, in, in that one axis, we have around 60,000 samples and this is the number of samples that we have like in the audio file which is cool. OK. So now let's try to extract the full transform coefficients and I'll hold it for, let's say the violent sound. So we'll do a uh FT or let's do violin FT where FT stands for fourier transform. And so if we're doing that, we'll use a NP dot FFT dot FFT.

Answer: and then pi array now. So, and this is basically like the, the waveform associated with this audio file. And if we take a look at the shape, we're going to see that this is like a uh an array and which has like only like one dimension. And the um like, I mean like in, in, in that one axis, we have around 60,000 samples and this is the number of samples that we have like in the audio file which is cool. OK.

Answer: So the next step is the crucial one is the one that we use for deriving the free transform. And we do that by using uh S IP specifically the FFT module. And we use the FFT which stands for fast fourier transform um function in the FFT module. So we pass it in the signal and we get the fourier transform. Now, I'm not going to show you what that result actually is because you need to have like mm a deeper understanding of math complex numbers and things that, that which you'll have in a few videos. But for now, the important thing to understand is that if we do the absolute, if we take the absolute value of the fourier transform, we actually get the magnitudes and this is the y axis of our spectrum.

    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ45IgG6rJ4&t=473s

Answer: OK. So the next step is to actually plot the waveform. And yeah, here we have like our nice little waveform. So once again, here we are in the time domain. So X axis is time, Y axis is amplitude and as you can see, so we have the attack of the sound and then we have a little bit of the DC and then yeah, the sound ends towards like 1.4 seconds. OK. So the next step is the crucial one is the one that we use for deriving the free transform. And we do that by using uh S IP specifically the FFT module. And we use the FFT which stands for fast fourier transform um function in the FFT module. So we pass it in the signal and we get the fourier transform.

2024-10-12 12:23:52,862 - config - INFO - Answer from OpenAI: The FFT approach, or Fast Fourier Transform, is used to derive the Fourier transform of a signal. It involves using the FFT module from a library (such as NumPy) to pass in the signal and obtain the Fourier transform. This method allows us to move from the time domain to the frequency domain, where we can analyze the frequency components of the signal. The result of the FFT gives us the Fourier coefficients, and by taking the absolute value of these coefficients, we can obtain the magnitudes that represent the y-axis of our frequency spectrum.

    QUESTION: Could you describe SFFT approach?

    CONTEXT: Answer: So if you look at this, you could say, well, if we have here like on the y axis, so like the amplitude is more than 0.2 or less than minus 0.2 then probably have an onset, right? And so we could use just like this very basic rule and then we would end up with this uh results. So we would be able to identify all of these guys like here, like vertical bars in red. And obviously, as you can see here, there are certain things that uh can't be identified and are like this smaller uh outbursts of energy here because like they are less than 0.2 or uh like in, in terms of like amplitude. And so we, we don't cover those with our simple rule, right? But this is like a an expert based approach. So we provided the rules to the system and the system has learned uh basically just like by what we we told it, told it to do,
    Video Title: 2- AI, machine learning and deep learning
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LLxZ35ru_g&t=462s

Answer: And basically what we do with a fourier transform is like the process of decomposing a periodic sound into a sum of sine waves which all vibrate oscillate like at different frequencies. So think about that, this is like quite incredible. So we can describe a very complex sound as long as it's periodic as a sum as the super imposition of a bunch of different sine waves and different frequencies. Like it's quite remarkable, isn't it cool? So, but let's like try to like uh visualize this because this could feel I know a little bit abstract. So let's start like with this uh sound wave over here.
    Video Title: 10 - Understanding audio data for deep learning
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3XbqfIij_Y&t=620s

Answer: and it uses deep neural networks. So what's a deep neural network is a neural network that has more than one hidden layer? So that's it. So this is deep learning basically. So using deep neural nets for solving all sorts of like very complicated problems and basically, throughout this series of videos, we're gonna be uh just like coding um uh deep neural nets and we're gonna be seeing like different flavors of like neural nets. Cool. So now let's take a look at the actual differences between traditional machine learning and deep learning. So the the main one that comes to mind is that in traditional machine learning, you have, you do a lot of feature engineering. Whereas in deep learning, you have another type of approach which is more end to end. So what do you mean by that? So let me explain because it could be like a little bit like tough, like to understand. So

Answer: um uh deep neural nets and we're gonna be seeing like different flavors of like neural nets. Cool. So now let's take a look at the actual differences between traditional machine learning and deep learning. So the the main one that comes to mind is that in traditional machine learning, you have, you do a lot of feature engineering. Whereas in deep learning, you have another type of approach which is more end to end. So what do you mean by that? So let me explain because it could be like a little bit like tough, like to understand. So uh let's let's focus a little bit like on feature engineering. So as we said, like in supervised learning. What we usually do is like we pass a lot of like label data to uh a machine learning algorithm and the algorithm uh learns and extracts like the rules from the data. But uh when I, when I mentioned supervised learning, uh first I ignored

Answer: uh given by Russell and Norvig in a book that's basically a Bible for artificial intelligence. And the book is called Artificial Intelligence and modern approach. And so the two scholars define A I as the the designing and building of intelligent agents that receive percept from the environment and take actions that affect the environment. So basically for the, for these guys for Russell and Norvig A I is just like the the creation, the science and the art of building like these intelligent agents. But then obviously one could ask but wait a minute, what's an intelligent agent? So here it seems that we are shifting the definition of artificial intelligence towards that of like an intelligence

    QUESTION: What audio features are there in an audio signal?

    CONTEXT: Answer: and but this is like important to understand. So we we start with low level features and then while we move from one convolution layer to the next we abstract higher level features. Cool. And so this is like an intuition how a CNN architecture uh works? Cool. OK. So now you may be wondering, OK, so we've spent so much time on talking about how wonderful CNN S are with images. So what about audio? After all, we are talking about deep learning for audio like in this uh uh series, right? Yeah. But uh the great thing is that uh we can think of audio in a sense itself as a, as an image, right? So if you guys remember, so what we usually use when we um use deep learning like audio. Uh we we use like spectrograms, we use MF CCS all of this type of like features, but now we've already like visualize them like as an image. And at the end of the day, these are big, we can be interpreted as images, right? Both the spectrogram and the MF CCS, right?

And at the end of the day, these are big, we can be interpreted as images, right? Both the spectrogram and the MF CCS, right? So uh in the case of a spectrogram, for example, time, the different time beings and the frequencies that we have here can be folded like the X and Y indexes for the the pixels of of an image

Answer: I don't know, like uh could be represented say by like a few circles uh which could be like the um the tires uh and a and a rectangle, for example, that could be like, I mean the whole uh like space like of the of the car uh like itself, right? So and but this is like important to understand. So we we start with low level features and then while we move from one convolution layer to the next we abstract higher level features. Cool.

Answer: uh that I want to ask you is like given like these uh settings for uh these like MF CCS like and for all of these audio data, what's gonna be like the, the data shape, right? So we have 13 MFCC, we have a hop length of 512 samples. Now, if you don't re remember what a hop length is or an MFCC uh like is just like go back to my previous videos where I introduced like all of these audio features. Cool. So we said hop length 512 samples and then we have the total number of samples in a audio file that we are analyzing. That's conveniently 51,200. Now, the question is what's the data shape that we, we, we're gonna expect our CNN to be fed with

So uh in the case of a spectrogram, for example, time, the different time beings and the frequencies that we have here can be folded like the X and Y indexes for the the pixels of of an image and the amplitude can be thought of the the the value associated to each pixel, right. So in a sense, a spectrogram is a two dimensional array which is really comparable to to an image. And the great thing is that a spectrogram and audio in general has

    QUESTION: What audio features are there in an audio signal?

    CONTEXT: Answer: uh or categorizing audio features for all sorts of audios? Yes. And this is like probably the most important kind of like strategy that you have for categorizing the different audio features. And uh this is based on like the signal domain that we are in. OK. So I know like this may sound a little bit weird but like with a few examples, it's gonna be super clear to like understand. OK. So we have certain audio features that are like in the time domain. So some of these are amplitude envelope root mean square energy or zero crossing rate. There are way more than this and we're gonna cover them in future videos. Uh But for now, uh I don't really want to get into the details of this different audio features. I just want to give you an idea why they are time domain features, right? OK. And this is because they are extracted from
    Video Title: Types of Audio Features for Machine Learning
    YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ9u1vUtcIA&t=504s

Answer: That's it. So now you should have more or less like an idea of the different types of audio features we'll be dealing with. So uh if there's one thing that I hope you'll take away from this uh video is that's like the main categorization that we can use instead of like the signal domain. So we, and that's like what we'll be doing in future videos, we'll be reviewing uh time domain audio features, frequency domain audio features and time frequency uh features as well. OK. So what's up next then? So now you have a good picture like of the different ingredients that we are going to play around with. So namely the audio features, the next step is to understand how we extract them directly from audio. So in the next video, we're gonna look at the feature

Answer: OK. So we have certain audio features that are like in the time domain. So some of these are amplitude envelope root mean square energy or zero crossing rate. There are way more than this and we're gonna cover them in future videos. Uh But for now, uh I don't really want to get into the details of this different audio features. I just want to give you an idea why they are time domain features, right? OK. And this is because they are extracted from away from us. So from the basic raw audio. And so

Answer: A I audio A I music and audio digital signal processing. So if you want to improve your skills and network with cool people, just consider signing up there and Olivia sign up link to the community in the description below. Now let's go back to the cool stuff in the previous video. We took a look at a few different types of uh audio features. So time domain features which uh leave in the time domain, frequency domain features which leave in the frequency domain and finally time frequency domain features which are features that provide us with information both about time and frequency. Now we want to take a look at the uh extraction pipelines that we can use to extract time and frequency domain features. So let's start with time domain features first. OK. So for the extraction pipeline, obviously, the first step is just to look at an analog sound, right? So it could be the sound of a violin, a noise. And then once we get
    Video Title: How to Extract Audio Features

Answer: So uh if you're familiar with my channel, you know that I literally love Python and it's not, this shouldn't come as a surprise to you that throughout the series, I'm gonna be using Python. And then on top of that, I'm gonna be using li browser, which is an open source audio processing libraries that we can use to extract loads of all your features in a very handy way. OK. So what will you learn from an operational standpoint? First of all, you're gonna get a deep dive into all your data so that you really know what you are talking about there and how to manipulate and preprocess all of this data. Then obviously you'll familiarize with um frequency and time domain or features and you're gonna be able to extract these features from rare audio. Most importantly, you recognize what are your audio features to use in your audio ML applications. So what makes the most sense for different types of applications? And along with that throughout this series, we're gonna, I'm gonna show you how to preprocess all your data and make it ready for your uh deep learning applications.
